REM Bat script for building Discount automatically

REM This path is needed for bash / posix compatibility inside the bash shell
REM TODO it would be nice if we could auto generate the bash path from the windows install dir path
set installdir_bash=../%name%

call setHopsanBuildPaths.bat
REM Make sure that the real msys is found first, TODO It would be better if we could tell the setupPaths script what msys environment to prefere
set PATH=%msys_path%;%PATH%

REM Copy code to build dir, not sure if out-of-source build is possible
mkdir %builddir%
cd %builddir%
xcopy %codedir%\* . /Y

REM Build with mingw patches

REM The first patch was taken from https://github.com/Alexpux/MINGW-packages/tree/master/mingw-w64-discount
REM It was however modified to grep for Msys instead of MINGW (from uname -a)
bash.exe -c "patch -p0 < ../discount-mingw-building.patch; patch -p1 < ../discount-2.1.8-msys.patch; CC=gcc ./configure.sh --shared --prefix=%installdir_bash% --confdir=%installdir_bash%/etc; make -j8; make install"
REM Note! We use msys make here as mingw32-make is to strict since 4.9.2

    Important Information
******************************

- See the issue-tracker https://github.com/Hopsan/hopsan/issues for all known issues.
  You can also report new issues, if you first create a GitHub account.

- There is no guarantee that the included component models are working under all conditions,
  you must decide for yourself if you trust the simulation results.

- When you load models saved with an older version of Hopsan, follow these recommendations to avoid loosing information:
  - Deactivate "Group Similar Messages" in the message widget at the bottom before loading a model.
  - Pay attention to any Warnings or Errors you may receive when loading your old model.
    If parameters fail to load they will be discarded.
  - Parameters and ports may have changed name, in such cases you have to manually set the parameter value that could
    not be loaded (according to messages).

- Sometime when exporting a model as PNG or PDF some components "vanish" or become very small. We have not been able to
  fix this problem. If this is a problem, take a screen-shot instead. You can quickly hide all of the side widgets with
  a button on the left pane.

- Hopsan internally relies on using the U.S English locale ( decimal separator '.' ) and should internally switch to
  this mode. Problems have been observed on some Ubuntu installations running with a different locale. Hopsan fails to
  interpret values with decimal separator '.' (it usually expects ','). If you do not want to change your system
  settings you can start Hopsan with the following command to locally ensure that U.S English numeric locale is used.
  Example:
    cd /opt/hopsan/bin
    LC_NUMERIC=C; ./hopsangui

2.21.1 (2023-06-20)

----- Bug Fixes -----

- DefaultComponentLibrary:
  - Remove external library file for the included ActivityDiagram sub directory
    This prevents compilation error of non-existing external library when the Windows version of Hopsan starts
    The library has been embedded into the default component library

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.21.0 (2023-06-10)

----- Important Change -----

- From this version onward, 32-bit releases are no longer built by default. If you need a 32-bit version, you will need to build it yourself or ask kindly in the issue tracker.
- This version replaces the FMI import functionality, so instead of compiling a specific FMU wrapper on import, an existing FMIWrapper component shall be used instead. It is available in the default library under the Connectivity category. This means that any model that included a generated FMI component from previous versions will not longer work. You need to replace that generated component with the new FMIWrapper component.

----- Enhancements -----

- Packaging:
  - Hopsan was added to Chocolatey, a package manager for Windows, see https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/hopsan for details
    Note! This package was added by an external contributor and is not directly built by the developers of Hopsan.

- HopsanCore:
  - Added connection-not-required argument to addSystemPort() function. This will only affect hand-coded "subsystem components"
    Default behavior is to require a connection
  - Extend pneumatic node type with density, density wave variable and density characteristic impedance
    This is required for correct computation of temperature and heat flow

- HopsanGenerator:
  - Support inline transformation of Laplace operator
  - FMI: Added FMI 3.0 import and export support
  - FMI: All FMI import is now handled through the FMIWrapper component (instead of regenerating and compiling a custom wrapper every time)
  - FMI: Added fmi4c dependency (FMILibrary is still kept for backwards compatibility)
  - FMI: Harmonized FMI export for 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 and removed unused template files

- HopsanGUI:
  - Improved find widget behavior when pressing Ctrl-F
  - Home button will now move to beginning of line if there are only spaces before cursor in the text editor
  - Do not add closing parenthesis when it has already been added in  the text editor
  - HCOM: New function ans() returns the answer from the previous computation. Only works for scalars
  - HCOM: New command rpco() which replaces a component by specified type. Replacement type must be specified in component appearance XML
  - HCOM: Support decimal number without decimal part bwfore e in expressions such as in x=14.e-3

----- Bug Fixes -----

- SymHop:
  - Only expand powers for integer exponents in SymHop

- HopsanGUI
  - Fix text editor parenthesis crash
  - Fix text file constant warnings that file has changed on disk, even if it was saved by Hopsan
  - Fix severe delays when saving text files
  - Fix crashes when attempting to view the source of a missing component
  - Fix crash when replacing subtype components with missing component
  - FMU Export would fail on Linux when using deb package installation as the required zip was not in the dependency list
  - Saving XML models and other XML data to Windows network drive share would take an extremely and unreasonably long time, it is now significantly faster
  - Remember original data when saving models with missing components
    This both eliminates the problem of accidentally saving a model with missing components and thereby losing data, and with the backup models being damaged during a failed library recompilation
  - HCOM: Fix undesired abort of script when using if statement without else

----- Component Libraries -----

- The component Q-type ground in the Electric->Sources was actually a C-type ground, it has been renamed
- A new component which is actually a Q-type ground has been added
- Fixed several potential "free of dangling uninitialized pointers" in generated components
  They apparently worked fine when built with GCC, but other compilers may have behaved differently
- Add activity diagram components to the default library
- Replaced old cavitation check i variable Q-type machine with a new check. Essentially, pressures are limited to zero implicitly by first limiting the flows to values required to get positive pressures. This solves problems with very large negative wave variables.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.20.0 (2022-07-11)

----- Enhancements -----

- HopsanCore
  - Move real-time simulation main loop into HopsanCore (from GUI) resulting in much better performance (animation mode)
  - Temporary files created by lookup components are now deleted on Linux systems when the model is closed
    (On Windows they will remain in the temp directory)

- HopsanGUI
  - Show HTML description in FMIWrapper component (extension library) if available in FMU
  - Replace functionality added to FindWidget for text files
  - Import/export parameter data to/from SSV format
  - Support SSV parameter sets for components (can be specified in component xml)
  - Add 'Energy Density Spectrum', 'Power Density Spectrum' and 'Root Mean Square' of vector to frequency analysis
  - Added "Open model file" option in right-click menu for subsystem components in library widget
  - Hide "Open source code" option for components that have no source code specified
  - Double-clicking on subsystem components opens model file
  - HCOM: Add steady-state identification, function ssi()
  - HCOM: New function: cut()
  - HCOM: Support elseif and nested if-statements
  - Make GUI fall back to empty port icon graphics for unknown node types
    This makes it possibly to register and use custom node types in custom component libraries
    Note! Custom nodes may not yet work in all cases, such as in code generation

- Ops
  - Support for surrogate models in Ops algorithms
    Surrogate models are fast numerical approximations of the objective functions.
    The implementation is based on polynomial response surfaces, as described by: https://doi.org/10.1007/s11081-014-9247-9
    To active surrogate models, add the command surrogatemodel <interval> in the HCOM script.
    The interval setting specifies how many evaluations the surrogate model is used before it is updated.

----- Bug Fixes -----

- HopsanGUI
  - Update default parameters when changing FMU in FMIWrapper component 
  - Ignore file change warning after saving a file. At least on Windows the file would otherwise be reported as modified
  - Loading HMF components as internal subsystems was forgotten when saving the model
  - HCOM: Fix SymHop evaluation of model parameters ending with 'e'
  - HCOM: Fix symhop evaluation of power if variable contains underscore, ex: a_b^2
  - HCOM: Fix hg() (highest generation) function, it did always return 0
  - Fix crash when adding new component to library
  - Ensure that error and warning messages about missing files when loading libraries actually contain the missing path
  - Spectrum/FFT dialog Crashes GUI if simulation was stopped by stop component
    time data was not truncated to actual number of simulated samples
  
- HopsanCore
  - Fix signal component sorting when a ReadMultiPort with multiple connections is present
  
----- Component Libraries -----
  - Standard Component Library: MechanicTranslationalLosslessConnector XML file error
  - Standard Component Library: SignalSteadyStateIdentifier

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.19.1 (2021-11-05)

----- Bug Fixes -----

- HopsanGenerator
  - FMU, S-Function and EXE export all failed to compile due to missing default library source code files
    They were not included due to a bug in packaging in 2.19.0
  - FMI ModelExchange import would not compile due to errors in the template code parameter type handling

- HopsanGUI
  - Energy loss calculation showed wrong value for domain-specific losses, and alternated between runs
    Also clarified added energy text
  - HopsanGUI would crash when a connected input variable port was disabled (removed)
    The checkbox is now disabled for connected ports

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.19.0 (2021-05-10)

--- Important Change ---

The HoLC (Hopsan Library Creator) application has been removed.
Its functionality has been built into HopsanGUI for some time, and can be accessed from the context menu (right-click)
in the library widget.

----- Enhancements -----

- HopsanC:
  - Make it possible to get data vectors by alias name in Python, Julia and Matlab

- HopsanGUI:
  - Make it possible to view XML and source code for default library components by right-clicking in library widget
  - Highlight connected connectors when hovering a component
  - HCOM: Support orphan variables in the chpvx command
  - HCOM: Enables defining and evaluating SymHop expressions
          Example: >> a=expr(sin(x)+y)
                   sin(x)+y
                   >> b=der(a,expr(x))
                   cos(x)
  - HCOM: Convert SymHop expressions to LaTeX
          Example: >> f=expr((a+b)/(c+d))
                   (a+b)/(c+d)
                   >> latex(f)
                   \dfrac{a+b}{c+d}
  - Monitor text files in editor tabs for external changes
  - Add "Always visible" setting for GUI components
    Use the context menu (right-click) on a component
  
- HopsanGenerator:
  - Various improvements in Simulink generator
    Hopsan S-functions now also support the "fast restart" option in Simulink
  - Various fixes and improvements to Modelica generator
  - Statically link to MinGW libraries for FMI export on Windows
    Removing dependency to correct version of MinGW DLLs in exported FMUs more 

----- Bug Fixes -----

- HopsanGUI:
  - Use interpolation-based down sampling to reduce vector size
    There was an error in reduceVectorSize function due to integer division
    The fix will affect all frequency analysis plots (spectrum, bode and nyquist)
  - Preserve rotation and flipping of replaced components

----- Component Libraries -----

- Enable end of stroke limitation in all C-type pistons
- Add moment of inertia quantity and make use of it in components
- PID2 component, changed the meaning of the 'de' input signal
  It is now expected to be a derivative input rather then a "error" delta
  If you have models using this component they may need to be updated
- Added markdown descriptions with equations for many commonly used default library components
  Note! Due to the large amount of added documentation, it has not yet been reviewed
  If you find something that looks odd, take a look at the component source code

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.18.0 (2021-02-25)

----- Enhancements -----

- HopsanCore:
  - New "filepath" parameter type (variable class HFilePath). It is basically string, but will enable a browse dialog button in
    the component properties dialog. File paths will be added relative to the model, if you want absolute paths, you will have to
    copy paste the path into to file path text field (like before)

----- Bug Fixes -----

- HopsanGUI:
  - Due to the random bug described below, starting optimization would instantly freeze the program

- Ops:
  - On the Windows version build with MinGW the random generator would return the same value on each call. It now returns actual random values
  - Due to this random bug, optimization would freeze during initialization (get stuck in an infinite loop)


----- Component Libraries -----

- Various improvements and fixes to the experimental FMI wrapper component (Extension library)
- LookupTable components now use the filepath parameter type to allow browsing for files

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.17.0 (2021-02-14)

----- Enhancements -----

- BuildSystem:
  - CMake build system can now build all Hopsan parts and support for the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler has been added
    Some issues still remain for CMake / MSVC builds, so this is not yet the default build system
    Build instructions have been updated, if you wish to use this build method

- Documentation:
  - Add link to tutorials under the help menu in HopsanGUI. There is now a more in-depth tutorial on the TLM method available.

- HopsanC:
  - List alternatives when querying for illegal port or variable names

- HopsanCore:
  - New "quantity" LeakageCoefficient added with various scale factors
  - Add Component::reconfigure() function that components can overload to reconfigure themselves
    Reconfigure is triggered when a parameter registered with the Component::setReconfigurationParameter(const HString &rName) function
    is changed.

- HopsanGUI:
  - Do not trigger auto complete popup after @
  - Do not auto select auto complete item while typing, user must press Tab, arrow keys or select with mouse
    This avoids the very annoying unintentional auto complete
  - Auto complete now replaces the entire completer prefix, to ensure that case is corrected
    Example: step.out.y -> Step.out.y
  - Fix auto complete not recognizing . in names such as Step.out.y
  - If you invert a plot curve using the curve controls, the setting will be remembered for the next generation
    If you want the invert curve setting to be persistent, check the box in the component properties instead
  - HCOM "edit" command now opens supported files in the Hopsan text editor instead of external editor (which quite often is not found)

- Ops:
  - Add elites parameter in genetic algorithm
    The best individuals are always carried over to the next generation without crossover and mutation.
    This helps avoid degradation of solution quality between generations.

----- Bug Fixes -----

- HopsanC:
  - Header file for hopsanc was not included in release
  
- HopsanGUI:
  - Do not clear undo-stack when a connector can not be found
  - Prevent renaming subsystem copy twice
    Fixes invalid name lookup for attached connector in undo
  - Fix hand icon getting stuck (finally after all these years)
  - Fix pasting system ports with connections
    They are no longer lost due to port being renamed
  - Fix enable/disable undo action syncing with changes in systems
  - Fix redo for subsystem paste
  - Process undo items in reverse order
    So that sub-operations are undone in the correct order
  - Fix redo for text widgets
  - Fix model lock-level detection for top-level system
    Prevents changes to model when model is locked
  - Prevent paste while left mouse button is pressed
    It would mess with the positions of the pasted components
  - Maybe fixed crash when simulation is finished, related to progress bar handling
    The problem could not be reproduced reliably (by the developers) so hard to know if it is fixed
  - Remove fade effect on red error flash in terminal, on some systems it would take a long time to fade
    Replaced by 400 ms solid read background
  - Fixed lock axis setting was forgotten when browsing to an empty generation
  - Fix splash screen not including version number and mentioning "development version"

- Ops:
  - Check for minimum number of candidates in DE algorithm, to avoid crash.
    DE algorithm requires four points

----- Component Libraries -----

- Renamed ContainerPort to SystemPort
  Containers (a type of system) were removed from Hopsan several years ago
- Turn off rotation for various signal component icons with symbols
- Added missing unit to leakage parameter for all pump/motor components
  Set the same default value for leakage parameter to 1e-12 for all pump/motor components
- Use consistent default parameter value for density 870 kg/m^3 in the default component library
- New component: Hydraulic differential pressure sensor
- Obsolete CppComponent and ModelicaComponent traces removed (were causing warning messages)
  The HopsanGenerator can generate proper components, so the old wrappers are no longer needed (and they no longer work)
- New component: (Extension library) Experimental FMI wrapper using reconfigure rather then requiring recompilation



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.16.0 (2020-11-08)

--- Important Change ---

To avoid name collision in HDF5 exports, the following names were reserved: Time, time, Frequency and frequency, 
HopsanGUI will attempt to automatically rename such components and system parameter when loading a model,
but HopsanCLI will not, and models must be updated in the GUI first.
To avoid name collision, the new names will have the _INVALID_NAME suffix appended.
You will need to change them manually if you wish.


--- Enhancements ---

- HopsanCLI:
  - Add command-line argument -p or --parallel to enable multi-core simulation from command line.
    Note! Small models do not benefit from multi-core and will in fact run much slower, measure first
    to decide if is useful for your model
  - Unify CSV and HDF5 output code to make them behave the same way
  - HDF5 exporter now uses the --logonly include filter
  - Only export relevant time vectors when --logonly specifies a subset of variables
    Example: If only a subsystem variable is exported, then only the time vector for that system is included
    
- HopsanGUI:
  - Updated QWT so that it works with new Qt versions
  - Make parameter export and import remember last used directory
  
- HopsanGenerator:
  - Update bundled 7z version to 19.00 (Only used on Windows)
    
--- Bug Fixes ---

- HopsanCore:
  - Restore PLO v2 format import to use one less number of data columns

- HopsanCLI:
  - If simulation is aborted, then the entire pre-allocated time vector will no longer be export. Only up to the last actual sample
  
- HopsanGUI:
  - Restore PLO v2 format export to use one less number of data columns (fix import crash)
  - System parameters widget was not updated when importing parameters from file
  - Do not tag model as changed when exporting parameters
  - Allow HCOM sequ command to change Quantity for particular generation or all generations
    Use the all option with care, as it will change the apparent unit on old data (without changing the actual data)
  - After changing quantities from HCOM, the component properties dialogs would not get updated
    They still need to be closed and opened
  - Fix ComponentPropertiesDialog not showing when you double-click (try to open it the first time).
    You were required to open it again, to actually show the dialog, also the model would be frozen in a non-editable state, due to hidden
    opened properties dialogs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.15.0 (2020-09-10)

--- Enhancements ---

New C-API shared library wrapper for Hopsan core with Julia, Matlab and Python language wrapper, see:
  Scripts/Julia/hopsan.j1
  Scripts/Matlab/hopsan.m
  Scripts/Python/hopsan.py

Update to Qt 5.9.9 and MinGW-w64 5.4.0 on Windows
  If you are building component libraries externally from an IDE, make sure that you use the new compiler (included with Hopsan)

- HopsanCore:
  - Add Kinsol solver (libsundials) for solving algebraic equation systems
    This library source code is bundled with and compiled into HopsanCore

- HopsanCLI:
  - Enable HDF5 export of log variables from HopsanCLI
  - Improved parameter export, with the following changes since previous versions
     * Parameter export no longer prefix the subsystem name twice to system parameters
     * System parameters in the top-level systems are prepended with the reserved name "self"
     This means that old parameter files containing system parameters will no longer import correctly, without manual editing
     However, parameter import was broken anyway, so that should not be a big problem (fixed in this release)
  - Enable filtering --logonly results on individual variables in ports
    The entire port is still logged in memory, but only the desired variables are written to CSV file

- HopsanGUI:

  - The built-in python terminal has been removed, because it never worked well, and caused a lot of maintenance problems
  - Apply icon scale when adding subsystem components
  - Add automatic numbering and referencing of equations in markdown (LaTeX) help documentation.
    Use LABEL=name and EQREF{name} according to the example in:
    exampleComponentLib\HydraulicComponents\MyExampleOrifice.md
  - Display highest generation command in HCOM, adds "dihg" command and "hg()" function

- HopsanGenerator:

  - Use standard Modelica attributes for input and output variables in Modelica importer
  - Complete rewrite of Modelica generator and related functionality
    See the included ModelicaExampleLib


--- Bug Fixes ---

- HopsanCore:
  - Fix compilation issue and stack overflow when using MSVC compiler
  - Fix PLO v2 import bugs (import did not work)

- HopsanCLI:
  - Fixed broken parameter import
  - The command line argument --logonly, did not consider system ports on subsystems

- HopsanGUI:
  - Always reload models before starting a new optimization, this avoids running old models if you make changes between optimization runs
  - Correct tab names and tab indexes after restoring HopsanGUI state, when multiple models and/or text editors were opened
  - Fixed PLO v2 export bugs
  - Fixed markdown help not being shown when markdown file does not include equations
  - Fixed LaTeX rendering of parentheses and brackets in help equations, (Updated to KaTeX 0.12.0)


--- Component Libraries ---

  - Add new component "AeroFlightRecorder" to the "AeroComponents" library
  - Resolves problem in SignalLogger with exponentially increasing simulation time due to appending and reallocating data vector
  - Fix SignalLogger file stream on Windows, so that all values get written
  - Fix incorrect equations in Gas Accumulator (HydraulicAckumulator)
  - Add missing embedded text support to PLOLookupTable
  - Display components (for animation) now has parameters for description, unit, unit scaling, precision, background color and text color

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.14.2 (2020-05-22)

--- Bug Fixes ---

- HopsanGUI:
  - Fixed new bug that prevented system parameters from automatically being copied into new systems when the
    component using them was copied
  - Fixed old bug where system parameters of other types then double would never be copied into a new system

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.14.1 (2020-05-17)

--- Enhancements ---

- HopsanGUI:
  - Add flat top windowing function to frequency analysis
  - Unset axis lock for the specific axis when changing units or X-axis variable
  - Optimization can now be aborted while evaluating initial candidates

--- Bug Fixes ---

- Packaging:
  - Ubuntu Eoan package no longer depends on libpythonqt-qt5-python3-3 which is not available in the package repository

- HopsanCore:
  - Fix bug in automatic model updater that would incorrectly add self. to constant parameter values if the parameter name and value
    expression were identical. In this case the intended result would be to use the parent system parameter of the same name

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.14.0 (2020-05-01)

This release contains an important change to how parameter referencing is done in start value expressions.
This change affects embedded scripts (numhop) and parameter value expressions. Previously when a named value was used in an expression,
the code first checked it the value was another parameter in the same component, then if one could not be found it checked in the parent
system, and then in the grand parent system, and so on.
This made it impossible to enforce choosing the parent system parameter if a local one of the same name existed.
This new change requires that parameters in the own component are prefixed by "self."
A named value not prefixed by self. is assumed to be part of the parent system, then the grandparent system and so on.
Parameter expression example:  self.a + self.b + a
Would add the local parameters 'a' and 'b', to the parent system parameter also named 'a'
Models saved prior to version 2.14.0 will be auto updated, with the exception for embedded model initialization scripts.
For these scripts a dialog window (and log message) will list the variables that need to be renamed.
Note! There are no changes to how components are implemented in C++, this only affects modeling in HopsanGUI.

--- Enhancements ---

- HopsanCore:
  - Use a more secure temp file generator to avoid security warning when compiling (mkstemp instead of tmpnam)
    If a "system environment temp" directory is not set, temporary files may end up in the Hopsan installation directory, under bin
    This is unlikely but may happen when running Hopsan from automated scripts
  - Make it possible to differentiate between a components own parameters and parameters in the parent or grand parent systems, by
    prefixing self. before parameter names in parameter expressions. For a components own parameters self. is now required.
  - It is no longer necessary (but still possible) to specify .Value (in parameterName.Value) when referring to own parameters such
    as start values in input/output ports
    Example: "2*self.in" instead of "2*self.in.Value"

- HopsanGUI:
  - Add HCOM support for self.Name in expressions using parameter values.
    Note! HCOM will not evaluate parameters in parent systems
    Note! HCOM will still work without 'self.'
    Note! HCOM scripts will not be auto updated
  - Real-time animation can now run at unlimited speed
  - You must now double-click in the workspace to open the quick-component insert dialog
  - Make it possible to use common HCOM math function on vectors (will evaluate per element)
  - Add "Save and Run" button the HCOM script editor

  - Add Windowing functions to frequency analysis tools.
    You can choose a time range of the logged data, and apply rectangular or Hann windowing functions
    Rectangular is the same as before (add no additional windowing)

- HopsanGenerator:
  - Export top-level system parameters as FMI parameters in exported FMUs
  - FMI parameter import is now also available for FMI1 (as well as FMI2)
  - Use Makefiles when compiling exported FMUs, this enables parallel compilation which is much faster

- Documentation:
  - Fix user documentation link for frequency analysis
  - Add missing documentation for HCOM script flow control

--- Bug Fixes ---

- HopsanCore:
  - Made parameter and system parameter evaluation behave the same way for all supported parameter types
    This fix is part of the reworked code that introduced self.Name parameter reference

- HopsanGUI:
  - Fixed auto-update to follow redirects (auto update did not work after moving files to GitHub)
  - Fixed crash when opening components with markdown documentation
  - Prevent crash when mixing model and editor tabs (editor tabs will now always open to the right of model tabs)
  - Fixed using referencing system parameter names for int and bool parameter types
  - Fixed evaluation of HCOM round() in expressions like round(x)*y
  - Change Bode plot frequency unit to rad/s, the values were in rad/s but previously the label claimed it was Hz
  - Fixed invalid unit being shown when mixing multiple different Quantities on the x-axis in plots (you should avoid this anyway)

- HopsanGenerator:
  - Fix import of parameter values for FMI v1 FMUs
  - Fix loading of FMUs with different file name and FMU name

--- Component Libraries ---

   components where the unit was previously hard-coded
 - Make many signal components replaceable with each other

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.13.0 (2019-11-26)

--- Enhancements ---

- HopsanGUI:
  - Improved library and code generation / development capabilities in HopsanGUI. It is now the preferred choice for library development.
    HoLC is deprecated and will not see further development or updates.
  - Libraries can now include Modelica .mo files (a subset is supported), and the corresponding c++ Hopsan components will be auto generated

--- Bug Fixes ---

- HopsanGUI:
  - Fixed drag-copying with right mouse button
  - Fix bug in arguments check for exec HCOM command
  
- HopsanGenerator:
  - Prevent generating header guards starting with digits (would fail for models whose name starts with a number)
  - Fix model assets export for stand-alone exe-export. Assets will be stored in a directory called modelname-resources
    This directory must accompany the exe file if it is moved.
  - Set better default permission for exported files, rw_rw_rw_ for code and rwxrwxr_x for executable files
  
--- Component Libraries ---

  - Lookup table components now have the option to add internal csv data as a parameter, this makes it easier to quickly
    create simple lookup tables without having to deal with external files
  - Lookup tables no support reading values from white-space padded columns
    Example:  1.0,  2.0,  3.0
             10  , 20  , 30  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.12.1-snap (2019-07-29)

This is a special release for the snap version of Hopsan.

--- Enhancements ---

- The snap now uses the base snap core18 (Ubuntu 18.04) and includes improvements for desktop theme support.
  The hopsan.gui and hopsan.holc applications should no longer look like "old software".
  Unfortunately dark themes are not yet working well, but this is a problem for all variants of Hopsan.

- Hopsan (snap version) will overwrite the compiler path so that the internal snap bundled version of the compiler
  is used automatically.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.12.0 (2019-07-15)

--- Enhancements ---

- HopsanCore:
  - Added petri net node type

- HopsanGUI:
  - Various text editor improvements
  - Enable saving and loading parameter sets to file (.hpf) for the entire model, sub-systems as well as individual components.
    Right click a component or subsytem to save or load parameter value sets.
    The HCOM sapa and repa commands have also been updated.

- HopsanCLI:
  - Made the --logonly command line argument affect only --resultsFullCSV output.
    --resultsFinalCSV will still include the final values from all ports.
    The purpose of --logonly is to reduce data amount for long simulations or optimizations with multiple iterations, but
    the --resultsFinalCSV data is not very large and having access to final values for ports that were not logged may be useful.

- HopsanGenerator:
  -Export model to black-box executable

--- Bug Fixes ---

- HopsanCore:
  - Fixed loading of parameter value sets for entire systems (including subsystems)

- HopsanGUI:
  - Fixed wrong XML tag when saving optimization settings

    Also adds common unit scales to HopsanGUI.
  - Add common math functions to embedded script (numhop), see users guide for details.
    You can now write expression like "x=cos(y)" or "a=atan2(b,c+2)"

- HopsanGenerator:
  - Added generator for compiler commands that should work with both GCC and Clang.
    This is only used for library import compilation right now. It will be extended to FMU exporting later.
    This should enable custom library importing on MacOS from HopsanGUI (but this has not been tested).

- HopsanGUI:
  - Built-in script editor for HCOM scripts.
  - Improved auto-completer in HCOM terminal.
  - Case insensitive auto-completer for filter function in component library widget.
  - It is now possible to add trace variables from multiple selected ports in the "debugging" widget.
  - Improved find widget Ctrl+F, it now behaves similarly as in other application.

  - Click anywhere on the workspace to quickly add new components. Write the name in the filter box.
  - The HoLC text editor functionality has been merged into HopsanGUI to improve and simplify the code editing experience.
  - Improved the save-state functionality so that it is possible to recompile libraries without first closing the models that are using them.
    Together with the code editor improvements this simplifies component development.

- HoLC:
  - Short-key Ctrl+G for quickly compiling (G for generate).
  - Zoom text with Ctrl+MouseWheel
  - Improved auto-completer, automatically show auto-complete suggestions while user is typing.
    Force-open auto-completer with Ctrl+Space
  - Find widget in HoLC text editor, open with Ctrl+F


--- Bug Fixes ---

- HopsanGUI:
  - Program crash after removal of disabled components.
  - Incorrect "parameter not used" warning when parameter values are given by expressions.
  - Plot unit selection does not allow a unit with scale one other than the base unit.
  - Import button in data explorer is now disable when no model is open, to prevent import data from
    going nowhere.
  - Crash when double-clicking scope in real-time animation without an existing generation.
  - Fix "real-time" plotting of play-back data. Now correct data index will be used instead of latest.
  - System parameters in expressions are not added when copy-pasting components into a new system.

--- Component Libraries ---

  - New spring-loaded switch animation component.
  - Add min and max limit parameters for animation slider component.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.10.0 (2018-09-28)

--- Important Changes ---

- The component library XML format has been updated.
  See the included "componentLibraries\exampleComponentLib\exampleComponentLib.xml" for details.
  Note! Hopsan will still be able to load files of the previous version.

--- Enhancements ---

- Models:
  - Models will now know what external component libraries they require.
    Libraries should have an <id> element in their XML file for this to work.
    See the included "componentLibraries\exampleComponentLib\exampleComponentLib.xml" for details.

- FMU:
  - When a model is exported to FMU or S-function, any required external component library will be included in the
    export and compiled into the target.
    Note! This requires that the source-code for the library is available and that all components, source files or
    special build flags (if any) are listed in the component library XML. You can use HoLC (Hopsan Library Creator),
    to add existing component files using a graphical users interface, but you can also update the library XML file
    manually in a text editor.
  - When a model that depend on data files (assets) is exported as an FMU, these files will now be included inside
    the FMU, in the (resources) directory.
    Note! Currently, any data file is included regardless of its size. This may pose a problem for very large files.
  - When a model is exported into an FMU, the exported directory structure is much cleaner, and the FMU easier to find.
    Temporary build and staging files are put into DESTINATION/fmu_build and DESTINATION/fmu_stage.
    These directories are deleted the next time an FMU is exported to the same directory.

- HoLC:
  - It is now possible to reload a file that was changed outside of HoLC, without restarting the program.
  - It is now possible to add multiple existing files at the same time.
  - Add existing files dialogues will now remember the last used directory.

--- Bug Fixes ---

- HoLC:
  - It is no longer assumed that the name of library main XML and cpp files are the same as the library.
    This allows overwriting existing library files on save.
  - Build flags are now preserved when loading and saving a library XML file.
    (You must still enter them manually in a text editor)
  - The file dialog suffix filters should now work.

- FMU:
  - Hopsan models exported as FMUs will no longer crash after 1/Ts simulation steps.

- HopsanGUI:
  - Prevent severe slowdown after simulation when result data is collected.
    This was especially noticable for large model or when many generations had been collected.

- Simulation:
  - Disabled components are now allowed to have non-connected ports.
    Note! If you disable components that are connected to enabled ones,
    the simulation may not behave as you expect.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.9.0 (2018-07-02)

--- Important Changes ---

- The HopsanGenerator library refactoring. GUI parts were split into a separate library and the library now has a C API
- All Hopsan source files now use the file suffix '.cpp' rather then mixing '.cpp' and '.cc'.
- All binaries now use lower-case names (hopsancli.exe instead of HopsanCLI.exe).
- Continuous integration (Travis CI) and (Appveyor) now builds and tests every change to the Hopsan code.
  This will reduce the risk of new code breaking old functionality.

--- Updates ---

- Update Qt to 5.6.3 on Windows (official Windows 10 support).
- Update the 64-bit Windows compiler to MinGW 4.9.4 (from 4.9.3). If you have manually set up a build environment for
  custom component libraries you are encouraged to update (use one of the Hopsan downloads with compiler included).
- Update ZeroMQ to 4.2.5

--- Enhancements ---

- Optimization:
  - Improved script file handling.
  - Improved variable names in plots.
  - Points are now sorted by objective value with DE algorithm.
  - Script generation is now shown in a separate wizard.
  - Reduced terminal output during optimization.
  - New algorithm, Genetic Algorithm.

- FMU:
  - Exported Hopsan FMUs will now report Warning and Error messages. Info messages will be reported as Debug type.
  - Imported FMUs will now have their messages redirected to the Hopsan core logger instead of standard output.
    messages should now be visible inside HopsanGUI. Enable Debug messages to see FMU Info messages.

- HopsanGUI:
  - HCOM:
    - Add PI constant 'pi()' in HCOM script.
    - Add argument to filter DIPA output
    - Add round, floor and ceil functions
    - Add unco command to list ports that are not connected
  - Export plot to image dialog will close after successful export.
  - Generator import/recompilation dialogs will now auto close if the import succeeds. Various improvement have also
    been made to the generator error handling to prevent importing old leftover files if compilation fails.
  - Improved Hopsan core log file handling, the log file is now put in the temporary directory next to log cache files.
  - Debug messages with log data collection speed has been added to help debug severe slowdown problems after the
    simulation is finish. Enable debug messages to show them.
  - The 32 bit version now includes openssl libraries so that the news feed can be accessed.

- HopsanCLI:
  - The HopsanCLI takes a new argument '--log.corelogfile' to specify core log destination.
    If not specified, the current working directory will be used.
  - It is now possible to choose what ports to log when simulating using HopsanCLI.
    Use the '--logonly' command line argument, and specify a comma-separated list of full port names.
    It is also possible to alternatively specify a text file with one full port name per line.
    Examples: Gain#out or SubsystemName#Gain#out
  - When saving results from a HopsanCLI simulation, interface ports (system ports) will also be saved.
  - Results saved by HopsanCLI now use scientific notation, this may increase precision for small values.

--- Bug Fixes ---

- Optimization:
  - Plot windows should be reusable.
  - Progress bars do not show with DE algorithm.
  - Excessive progress bars are not removed when reducing number of models.
  - Total progress bar is not updated with PSO algorithm.

- FMU:
  - An exported Hopsan FMU will not signal failure if initialize or simulate fails.
  - FMUs from JModelica cannot be imported.
    The import code now supports 'CS and ME' FMUs. In this case the Co-Simulation variant will be used.

- HopsanGUI:
  - The auto update link parser ignores Hopsan without compiler links.
  - Animation crashes when variable is NaN or inf.

--- Component Libraries ---

- Fix inverted port initialization error in HydraulicTLMlossless.
- Fix error in pilot operated check valve.
- Fix error in HydraulicPistonAccumulator.
- The "Extension library" is now included by default with Hopsan. You can load it from the Hopsan installation directory.
  This library contains experimental new components that have not yet been added to the default library.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.8.2 (2018-03-02)
- Bug fixed: HCOM max(abs(var)) fail to evaluate if var is a vector (also affects min)
- Bug fixed: Optimization: There should be a comma separator between the numbers in the parameter outputs

- Enhancement: It is now possible to choose what temp directory to use for the Hopsan GUI cache.
               This may be helpful if the default directory is located on a slow network drive.
               After each simulation, potentially very large log data cache files will be written here.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.8.1 (2017-11-30)
- Bug fixed: Prevent notifying that a new version is available if Hospan release "revision" is newer then the HopsanGUI "revision" in the same release.
- Bug fixed: Numbers are inverted in custom unit scale display dialogue. Actually they were not. They were supposed to be part of an equation, this is now shown.
- Bug fixed: If Hopsan is terminated or crash while the configuration file is saved, it will no longer become corrupt. (The previous version will remain intact)
- Bug fixed: The Linux version of Hopsan 2.8.0 can not dlopen libHopsanGenerator making it impossible to (re)compile external component libraries

- Enhancement: Auto download of new (Windows) versions will now save installer to the user "temp" directory rather than the "data" directory.
               You should check your data directory for old installers and delete them manually!
               Look in "C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\HopsanGUI" or similar.
- Enhancement: Greatly improved error/warning  message output while loading external libraries, this should prevent bug: "Sometimes external components fails to load without error message"
- Enhancement: Added km/h, mph and knot custom speed units (Note! You can add your own in the Options menu if your favorites are missing)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.8.0 (2017-10-13)
- Change: Moved source code to GitHub: https://github.com/Hopsan/hopsan
          Due to switching source code version control system from Subversion to Git(Hub), significant changes have been made to the build system and version numbering format.

- Change: New version numbering format (we also bumped the epoch number to avoid confusion with the previous generation of Hopsan (Version 1.4 released in 2001)
          The new full version number format is: EPOCH.MAJOR.MINOR.DATE.TIME~BRANCH_NAME
          For official releases, only the three first numbers will be shown in the file name, example: 2.8.0. But internally and for snapshots the date and time of the last commit will be appended.
          This gives a behaviour that is similar to the monotonically increasing revision number used previously when the source code was handled by Subversion.
          Optionally the branch name may be appended in the end (for experimental or snapshot builds, that do not originate from the "master" branch.

- Change: Re-licensed HopsanCore, HopsanCLI, libOps, libSymHop, libHopsanGenerator and libDefaultLibrary to Apache License 2.0
          This is a more permissive license than the GPL license previously used.
          Essentially: If you create derived work of the Hopsan core components (and distribute that work), your work must no longer be released under the GPL license.
          Note! HopsanGUI and HoLC (the GUI applications) are still GPLv3 licensed.
          Read the full license notices for details.

- Change: Removed obsolete csv_parser++ library (GPL licensed) from HopsanCore
          libIndexingCSVParser is used everywhere instead (compiled into HopsanCore)

- Change: Removed Intel Thread Building Blocks library.
          HopsanCore now relies on C++11 std::threads for multi-threading capabilities.

- Feature: Vector signal nodes. Note! Only realized by 2D node components as of yet.
           These nodes are still static, so there would have to be a set of components for every vector size.
- Feature: Bi-directional signal ports (2D) read/write.
           See external Grafcet example library
- Feature: HCOM New 'eval' command, Evaluate string expressions.
           Example: eval "chpv Gain$i$.out.y" would first evaluate the variable i and then execute the 'chpv' command
- Feature: HCOM New 'mkdir' command, to create directories. 
           This may be useful when automate saving of data

- Enhancement: The version check and auto update (Windows only) system has been improved. If you have downloaded a version with the compiler included,
               the auto update will now be able to download the new version also with the compiler included.

- Bug fixed: Prevent crash when copying HVectors of HStrings

- Bug fixed: Confusion in variable lookup when matching against alias names, causing incorrect behaviour of rmvar HCOM command (and likely others),
             'rmvar aliasname', will now remove the alias variable itself and unregister the alias name from the actual real variable.

- Enhancement: Increased precision (double to string conversion) of some HCOM scalar outputs and the plot markers display text.
- Enhancement: The 'to_hstring' utility function now takes an additional 'precision' argument, so that the precision of the resulting string
               can be chosen. The default value is 17, this resolves issues with evaluated numerical expressions in parameters getting truncated.
- Enhancement: Limited boolean operator support in numhop, true = 1 and false = 0

               The user name can be set in HopsanGUI or supplied to the RemoteClient command line tool.
- Enhancement: Disabled editing, solver selection and recompile button in the code viewer (in Component Properties) for C++ components since it is not possible to  
               actually change / recompile individual components from within HopsanGUI. This was causing confusion.
- Enhancement: Disabled the "Dual View" in the library widget since it will fail to show all components in some cases. Fixing the problem will require to much work,
               the code is still there if someone want to give it a try. This change also removes the "HelpButton" but the UsersGuide is still available through the help menu.

- New component: Hydraulic Piston Accumulator has been added  

- Bug fixed: When loading a model from a 0.6 version of Hopsan using custom parameter scales, the scale factors are inverted in the properties dialog.
             (Simulation is not affected!)
             When a scale mismatch is detected on loading a model, it will now be updated to the latest version.
             Note! Since old versions of Hopsan does not have this fix, the unit scales saved in a model from Hopsan 0.7 are not backwards compatible with Hopsan 0.6.
- Bug fixed: It is not possible to use HCOM function calls as arguments to HCOM commands if spaces exist in the argument list to the function call
- Bug fixed: HCOM crash if taking square of temporary vector expression
- Bug fixed: Rare crash due to "double free" in SymHop Expression destructor 
- Bug fixed: HCOM scalar/vector division falls back to startvalue for vector name instead of using the vector
             It will now be interpreted as (scalar * 1 ./ vector) (scalar * Element-wise inverted vector)
- Bug fixed: In xy-plots the unit label for custom x-axis was incorrect, it got the y-axis unit

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.7.3  (2016-02-23)
- Feature: Running optimizations from HopsanCLI

- Enhancement: If you select multiple system parameters then all components with selected parameters will be highlight
- Enhancement: No longer listing system port variables twice in the plot widget
- Enhancement: PortType is now saved in port tag in model xml (for external tools)

- New component: Mechanic worm drive

- Bug fixed: If you close a model the numhop script dialog is not closed with it
- Bug fixed: Sometimes no data is saved in the log variables collected from the core (if you start a second Hopsan instance the cache files were deleted)
- Bug fixed: It is no longer possible to add or change system parameters in "limitedlocked" systems
- Bug fixed: When editing a system parameter of other type then double, the type selector still defaults to double
- Bug fixed: Crash on Windows 8 and 10 after renaming a system port and later saving (or in some other way triggering refresh port appearance)
- Bug fixed: Parameter sweep optimization is not working, sometime dialog is crashed as well

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.7.2  (2016-02-06)
- Feature: Additional versions of the Windows installer and zip release are now available with the compiler included.
           This version will default to the internal compiler (see options to set other compiler paths).
           Note! For compression reasons (to keep the file small) the portable "zip" release including compiler uses the "7z" format
                 and requires the free "7-Zip" program from http://www.7-zip.org/ to unpack.
- Feature: Hopsan can now utilize remote simulation services for parallel simulation during sensitivity analysis.
           Note! This is only beneficial for large models that take a long time to simulate. Overhead from remote loading of models and especially transferring data back
           to the HopsanGUI will add to the total simulation time for each model.

- Enhancement: Imported FMUs will now inherit ComponentSignal by default, (instead of Q-type). When a HopsanTLM port specification is present in the FMU the C or Q
               type can be decided in that file (using the "tlmcqtype" tag). If not specified, Q-type will be assumed.
- Enhancement: FMU import HopsanTLM specification now works with all built in node types in Hopsan. (Before, only Hydraulic and Mechanic ports were supported)
               The Hopsan node type name must be used in the "type" attribute of the "tlmport" tag. Example: "NodeElectric" not "electriccq".

- Bug fixed: Exported FMU wont compile due to failed namespace replacement in new code
- Bug fixed: The simulate multiple models or all open models code in the ModelHandler sometimes causes crash after simulation
- Bug fixed: When importing FMU the FMILibrary path does not work if Hopsan is installed in for example "Program Files" (space in path)
- Bug fixed: Highlighting components using system parameters does not work if system parameter is used in expression
- Bug fixed: Importing FMU with _ in name causes problems (due to to strict toValidVariableName function)
- Bug fixed: Crash if trying to use remote parallel optimization using an algorithm or method that has not been implemented in the scheduler
             It will now fall back to parallel queuer without load balancing
- Bug fixed: Fixed incorrect rad/s -> rpm unit scale
- Bug fixed: Fixed rare crash bug in SymHop library 
- Bug fixed: Fixed crash bugs related to optimization "hidden models"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.7.1  (2016-01-28)
- Enhancement: It is now possible to trigger the "invert plot" function for a data variable through the plot curve controls.
- Enhancement: The time offset dialog and hcom commands now use the selected default time unit for input and output
- Enhancement: NumHop dialog now has an apply button so that you can edit and apply changes without closing the dialog

- Fixed component: CylinderC now have the possibility to disable internal end stop simulation
- Fixed component: Lookup table components are no longer tagged as Experimental (they seem to be working)
- Fixed component: Hydraulic32DirectionalOnOffValve does not allow flow from load port to tank after bug fix to 0.7.0.
                   Also added validation tests to prevent this from happening again
- Fixed component: Electric motor components had wrong unit for Viscous friction coefficient (only fixed in generated C++ code)

- Bug fixed: When opening component properties dialog for a subsystem the model is locked, the dialog seems to be modal (it now behaves as ordinary components)
- Bug fixed: Added missing check for feasible region in differential evolution optimization algorithm

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.7.0  (2016-01-26)
- Note: This version has been in development for approximately one year.
        There are many changes that are not mentioned in these release notes.
- Note: The abs HCOM command has been removed, use the abs() function instead.
- Note: The HCOM plot scale and plot offset commands have been removed. (The features have been removed as well)
        Use quantities or generation specific time plot offset
- Note: The core Component functions setInitialValue() and readNodeSafeSlow() and writeNodeSafeSlow() have been removed. Use writeNodeSafe() or readNodeSafe() instead.
- Note: Now one logdata handler is shared for the entire model instead of for each individual subsystem, this greatly simplifies working with Generations of data.
        The full system hierarchy of data is now available in the same tree.
- Note: We have finally chosen a real license, and made sure that third-party dependencies are compatible.
        This version of Hopsan is released under the GNU GPL version 3 license.
        If you would like to use a different license, please contact Fluid and Mechatronic Systems, Linköping University,
        and consider sponsoring the development of Hopsan.
- Note: This release has updated to MinGW-W64 4.9.3 and a custom compiled version of the Qt Libraries 5.4.2 (for this 64-bit compiler)
        See the documentation for details.

- Feature: A remote Hopsan simulation framework has been developed and is included in this release.
           Unfortunately there is no documentation about how to use it but if you are clever, you can probably figure it out.
           Run the following programs with the "--help" flag for more information:
           hopsanaddressserver.exe, hopsanserver.exe, hopsanserverclient.exe, hopsanservermonitor.exe
           HopsanGUI can connect to the server(s) and run remote simulation, and some optimization algorithms can run in parallel if many server computers are set up.
           Note! This is VERY experimental.
- Feature: It is now possible to set plot label in the component properties dialogue, this label will be used in plot legend (overwriting full name and alias)
- Feature: Components (including subsystems) in a model can now be locked, which prevents editing
- Feature: Ii is now possible to revert model to the last saved state without loosing plot windows and log data generations (Tools menu)
- Feature: It is now possible to invert specific plot variables from HCOM "ivpv" and component properties
           Inverting may be useful for analysis purposes, but only the plot curves will be affected. The data will keep the correct value.
- Feature: HopsanGUI can now automatically compile (and recompile) External component libraries when they are loaded.
           This means that you no longer need an external build environment for component library development. 
           (You can still use that for advanced development)
- Feature: It is now possible to recompile or reload external component libraries from the library widget right-click menu.
           Provided, that the correct compiler version is installed and selected in Options. (See documentation for details)
- Feature: It is now possible to start HopsanGUI from the command line, and pass a HCOM script as the first argument. The script will be executed on start-up.
           Note! the script file name used as the argument must end in .hcom, otherwise it will be treated as an hmf file to load.
- Feature: Quantities definitions have been moved to the simulation core, so you can now assign quantities directly in the component code
- Feature: It is now possible to set Quantity on signals (that have no quantity set in code) so that the desired description and units are used in plots.
           Instead of showing "Value". Note! No check will be done that units match, you have to take care of that yourself.
- Feature: HopsanGUI now supports data export in the standardized HDF5 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format format. 
           This format has import support in many popular softwares. The format stores data without truncation and includes variable meta data.
           A helper scripts for convenient import in Matlab is included in the Hopsan release (Check the Scripts directory)
- Feature: Help description for components can now be written in Markdown (a simple text format) that is automatically converted to HTML in HopsanGUI.
           Additionally LaTeX equations are supported and will automatically be rendered into the HTML document.
- Feature: A model embedded script language NumHop is now part of each system component. Using NumHop you can write an initialization script
           that will be run for each system to set defaultStartValue parameter. This is useful if you need to calculate start values based on other parameters
           in your model. See the NumHop script section in the documentation.
- Feature: Symbolic expressions can now be used as parameter values, this make it possible to base one parameter on another in the same component or 
           use a system parameter directly or included in a mathematical expression. See the NumHop script section in the documentation.
- Feature: It is now possible to set star values in system ports.
- Feature: It is now possible to save the state of a simulation and to later load that state to continue the simulation from a certain point.
           Note! Internal states of the components are not saved, only the interface (node) values. You make the save/restore at steady-state.
           This functionality is available in the HopsanCLI (see CLI documentation)
           And in the HopsanGUI see the Export menu, and the -loadstate and -loadsv argument to the HCOM "sim" command.
- Feature: It is now possible to get node data pointer structures from ports, this makes it easier to write cleaner component code.
           Especially if you have many ports or even multi ports. Currently this is experimental and only available for Hydraulic and Mechanic nodes.
- Feature: The HoLC (HopsanLibraryCreator) program is included in this release, you can us it to generate the component library files and component code skeletons.
           It also offers limited code editor functionality.
- Feature: External subsystems (.hmf) can now be used as components in the component library

- Enhancement: HCOM set command can now take variables as arguments
- Enhancement: HCOM get command, which displays current settings
- Enhancement: HCOM help command will auto try functions if no matching command was found

- Enhancement: It is now possible to have multiple help links in the component help
- Enhancement: Help links can point to either local files, relative to the xml description, or to on-line web pages.
- Enhancement: Unit scaling with offset as well as scale are now supported (such as temperature)
               The scale and offset values follows the same convention as in the FMI standard
- Enhancement: Built in unit scales will no longer be saved in user configuration file, the default built-in values will always be used.
               This reduces the risk of using incorrect values.
- Enhancement: System parameters now support quantities/units and description
- Enhancement: It is now possible to edit system parameters after they have been added
- Enhancement: It is now possible to plot and check parameters (but not edit) inside fully locket external systems and locked local systems
- Enhancement: When the component properties dialogue is opened the model is locked to prevent editing, however, now it is possible to open additional properties dialogues
               or start a simulation. The dialogues have been given an apply button. You can now iterate the following: open a dialogue, change a parameter, simulate, look
               at the results. All without ever closing any windows or dialogues.
- Enhancement: The component properties dialogue for subsystems now look and behave the same as for ordinary components.
               But it still contain additional system specific settings.
- Enhancement: The expended items in the plot widget will now be remembered when you switch between two different models
- Enhancement: When exporting a model as .png, it is possible to choose if the background should be transparent or white. The original resolution is also shown.
- Enhancement: When a data variable is removed it will signal any plot using it to remove the curve or a curve custom x-data as appropriate.
               This reduces confusion when analysing the results.
- Enhancement: When a generation is missing from a data variable, that data curve will be hidden if the curve is set to that generation.
               (Rather then showing the wrong generation).
- Enhancement: When offsetting time for a specific generation, now all "Time" vectors in that generation will be affected at the same time.
               Time offset can be applied and checked from time offset dialogue, right-click menu in plot widget or HCOM commands "chto" and "dito".
- Enhancement: Systems and components now save their CQS-type as an attribute in the HMF file

- Documentation: The documentation has been reorganized and updated with new information about, how to setup the build environment to build Hopsan as a developer.
                 how to install the compiler for automatic compilation of External component libraries. Some new features are also covered, but sadly the documentation
                 is still lagging behind in some areas.
- Documentation: Added HCOM documentation on how to change curve styles from plot commands

- New components: Round, Ceil and Floor signal components
- New components: NumHop SingleInput SingleOutput interpreting component, write NumHop script that is evaluated without compilation. 
                  Code can be extended to support more inputs and outputs.
- New components: Hydraulic and Mechanic NodeSensor as well as Mechanic C and Q TLM input components make it possible to "graphically" program
                  the Transmission Line equations in a subsystem block. Note! this is still an experimental feature and performance will be lower
                  then if you write the code manually. 

- Fixed component: Some directional valve components had different speeds in positive and negative direction
- Fixed component: HydraulicCylinderC now has built in end-stops, so you should no longer rely on the connected Q-component (usually mass) to limit the stroke.

- Bug fixed: Messages from optimizations no longer appears in main window terminal
- Bug fixed: Memory leak when re-using models for subsequent optimizations
- Bug fixed: It is possible to copy/paste in locked external systems, it should not be possible
- Bug fixed: When a model is locked (external system) it is still possible to change or remove system parameters through the system parameter widget
- Bug fixed: When sorting the system parameters in the system parameter widget, the row indexes are messed up, making operations affect the wrong parameter
- Bug fixed: If you remove a system parameter from a system used as an external system, then the old parameter will be re-added once the master model is loaded
- Bug fixed: Hopsan crash after simulation due to progress bar deletion if something got in the way between finalizeDone signal and finish slot.
             (actually this was a problem with non blocking signals and slots)
- Bug fixed: Pressing Ctr+C (copy) without something selected will clear the current copy/cut stack.
             Not fun if you made something fancy, cut and then accidentally press copy instead of paste.
- Bug fixed: It is not possible to plot from a scope connected directly to a container port
- Bug fixed: Variables in subsystems do not know from which model they come
- Bug fixed: When setting a non string parameter to empty no error is shown and resulting evaluation will be zero
- Bug fixed: Can not reset string constants to default value if default value is empty string
- Bug fixed: External subsystem connectors are lost on copy paste
- Bug fixed: If you load a model containing a subsystem saved as a component and that component is not available in the library,
             nothing is created and no messages are shown. (There was a debug message but it has now been changed into an error message)
- Bug fixed: The default unit scale value for converting between Hz and rad/sec is inverted. (This was previously fixed in 0.6.12) but now 
             with quantity support in the code and a new unit scale system in the GUI, this is no longer an issue.
             Either you have frequency in rad/s (then use the Frequency quantity) or write unit Hz directly (then unit scaling will not work). 
- Bug fixed: Deactivated ports are not saved, so they reappear once a model is reloaded.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.6.12  (2015-09-03)
- Note! We strongly suggest that you reset your configuration file ("Reset defaults" button in options dialog) after updating to this version, due to the erroneous handling of frequency unit scaling

- Bug fixed: The definition of Frequency scaling requires the base unit to be the SI-UNIT Hz, but in Hopsan we actually use rad/s.
             The default configuration setting for Frequency was inverted so that it scales relative to rad/s instead of Hz
             You need to reset your configuration file after updating to this version.
             If you have used Frequency scaling previously, you should really reload that model and reset the scaled parameter.
             Then make sure that you enter the correct frequency value.
             If you do not, an incorrect scale will be used.

- Bug fixed: Subsystem sometimes move from where you left them the second time you open them
- Bug fixed: Lookup Tables fail to read CSV files with Windows line endings
- Bug fixed: Calling initialize on SecondOrderFilter will not reset the output value variable, its value remains unchanged
- Bug fixed: HopsanCore simulation freeze sometimes when calling stopSimulation() during multi-core simulation
- Bug fixed: Fixed crash in optimization finalize function
- Bug fixed: Made sure disabled ports in original model are respected by optimization handler
- Bug fixed: When creating a new subsystem the default viewport is set to the top-left corner

- Fixed component: Fixed division by zero in hydraulic pressure controlled pump component
- Fixed component: Enabled stroke limitation of HydraulicCylinderC. Hopefully it works as intended
- Fixed component: Rewrote cavitation handling in CylinderQ
- Fixed component: Allow negative c in volumes in CylinderC (to avoid creating oil out if nothing when we get cavitation)

- Enhancement: When renaming a system parameter in the systems parameter widget, the values in components using the parameter should be updated to the new name
- Enhancement: Added backup and restore functions to first and second order transfer functions

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

               Some commands may have changed behavior (hopefully for the better)
- Enhancement: Port labels file in Simulink export now have a model specific name
- Enhancement: The component library widget has been completely rewritten to solve a number of problems.

         Note! The plotwindows can now have the same "display name" but "behind the scenes" the plotwindow name will be different.
         This means that you may not be able to switch the active plotwindow from HCOM.
- Fixed: When you load an external lib containing the same components as an earlier lib, those components are "removed" from earlier libs
- Fixed: When importing data containing Time, the Time variable will be moved to the __Imported__ category even though it should be shown in both categories.

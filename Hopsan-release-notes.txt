******************************
    Important Information
******************************

- See the issue-tracker (link on web page) for all known issues.

- Older versions of Hopsan may crash if the configuration file is saved with a newer version. Delete the configuration file to solve this. 
  In Windows it is usually located in: c:\Users\XXXXX\AppData\Local\Temp\Hopsan
  In Ubuntu it is usually located in: /home/XXXXX/.local/share/data/Hopsan

- There is no guarantee that the default components are working under all conditions, you have decide for yourself if you trust the simulation results.
  From version 0.6.0, the source code for all default components is included in the release.

- There have been substantial "under the hood" changes between the 0.6.* and 0.7.* versions of Hopsan.
  Loading old models in 0.7.0 should work without issues in most cases, HOWEVER, to be sure that you do not loose any information:
  * Deactivate "Group Similar Messages" in the message widget at the bottom before loading a model.
  * Pay attention to any Warnings or Errors you may receive when loading your old model. If parameters fail to load they will be discarded.
  * Parameters and ports may have changed name, in such cases you have to manually set the parameter value that could not be loaded (according to messages).
  
- Sometime when exporting a model as PNG or PDF some components "vanish" or become very small. We have not had time to fix this problem.
  If this is a problem take a screen-shot instead.

    Version History
******************************
0.7.1  (2016-02-28)
- Enhancement: It is now possible to trigger the "invert plot" function for a data variable through the plot curve controls.
- Enhancement: The time offset dialog and hcom commands now use the selected default time unit for input and output
- Enhancement: NumHop dialog now has an apply button so that you can edit and apply changes without closing the dialog

- Fixed component: CylinderC now have the possibility to disable internal end stop simulation
- Fixed component: Lookup table components are no longer tagged as Experimental (they seem to be working)

------------------------------
0.7.0  (2016-01-26)

- Note: This version has been in development for approximately one year.
        There are many changes that are not mentioned in these release notes.
- Note: The abs HCOM command has been removed, use the abs() function instead.
- Note: The HCOM plot scale and plot offset commands have been removed. (The features have been removed as well)
        Use quantities or generation specific time plot offset
- Note: The core Component functions setInitialValue() and readNodeSafeSlow() and writeNodeSafeSlow() have been removed. Use writeNodeSafe() or readNodeSafe() instead.
- Note: Now one logdata handler is shared for the entire model instead of for each individual subsystem, this greatly simplifies working with Generations of data.
        The full system hierarchy of data is now available in the same tree.
- Note: We have finally chosen a real license, and made sure that third-party dependencies are compatible.
        This version of Hopsan is released under the GNU GPL version 3 license.
        If you would like to use a different license, please contact Fluid and Mechatronic Systems, Linköping University,
        and consider sponsoring the development of Hopsan.
- Note: This release has updated to MinGW-W64 4.9.3 and a custom compiled version of the Qt Libraries 5.4.2 (for this 64-bit compiler)
        See the documentation for details.

- Feature: A remote Hopsan simulation framework has been developed and is included in this release.
           Unfortunately there is no documentation about how to use it but if you are clever, you can probably figure it out.
           Run the following programs with the "--help" flag for more information:
           HopsanAddressServer.exe, HopsanServer.exe, HopsanServerClient.exe, ServerMonitor.exe
           HopsanGUI can connect to the server(s) and run remote simulation, and some optimization algorithms can run in parallel if many server computers are set up.
           Note! This is VERY experimental.
- Feature: It is now possible to set plot label in the component properties dialogue, this label will be used in plot legend (overwriting full name and alias)
- Feature: Components (including subsystems) in a model can now be locked, which prevents editing
- Feature: Ii is now possible to revert model to the last saved state without loosing plot windows and log data generations (Tools menu)
- Feature: It is now possible to invert specific plot variables from HCOM "ivpv" and component properties
           Inverting may be useful for analysis purposes, but only the plot curves will be affected. The data will keep the correct value.
- Feature: HopsanGUI can now automatically compile (and recompile) External component libraries when they are loaded.
           This means that you no longer need an external build environment for component library development. 
           (You can still use that for advanced development)
- Feature: It is now possible to recompile or reload external component libraries from the library widget right-click menu.
           Provided, that the correct compiler version is installed and selected in Options. (See documentation for details)
- Feature: It is now possible to start HopsanGUI from the command line, and pass a HCOM script as the first argument. The script will be executed on start-up.
           Note! the script file name used as the argument must end in .hcom, otherwise it will be treated as an hmf file to load.
- Feature: Quantities definitions have been moved to the simulation core, so you can now assign quantities directly in the component code
- Feature: It is now possible to set Quantity on signals (that have no quantity set in code) so that the desired description and units are used in plots.
           Instead of showing "Value". Note! No check will be done that units match, you have to take care of that yourself.
- Feature: HopsanGUI now supports data export in the standardized HDF5 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format format. 
           This format has import support in many popular softwares. The format stores data without truncation and includes variable meta data.
           A helper scripts for convenient import in Matlab is included in the Hopsan release (Check the Scripts directory)
- Feature: Help description for components can now be written in Markdown (a simple text format) that is automatically converted to HTML in HopsanGUI.
           Additionally LaTeX equations are supported and will automatically be rendered into the HTML document.
- Feature: A model embedded script language NumHop is now part of each system component. Using NumHop you can write an initialization script
           that will be run for each system to set defaultStartValue parameter. This is useful if you need to calculate start values based on other parameters
           in your model. See the NumHop script section in the documentation.
- Feature: Symbolic expressions can now be used as parameter values, this make it possible to base one parameter on another in the same component or 
           use a system parameter directly or included in a mathematical expression. See the NumHop script section in the documentation.
- Feature: It is now possible to set star values in system ports.
- Feature: It is now possible to save the state of a simulation and to later load that state to continue the simulation from a certain point.
           Note! Internal states of the components are not saved, only the interface (node) values. You make the save/restore at steady-state.
           This functionality is available in the HopsanCLI (see CLI documentation)
           And in the HopsanGUI see the Export menu, and the -loadstate and -loadsv argument to the HCOM "sim" command.
- Feature: It is now possible to get node data pointer structures from ports, this makes it easier to write cleaner component code.
           Especially if you have many ports or even multi ports. Currently this is experimental and only available for Hydraulic and Mechanic nodes.
- Feature: The HoLC (HopsanLibraryCreator) program is included in this release, you can us it to generate the component library files and component code skeletons.
           It also offers limited code editor functionality.
- Feature: External subsystems (.hmf) can now be used as components in the component library

- Enhancement: HCOM set command can now take variables as arguments
- Enhancement: HCOM get command, which displays current settings
- Enhancement: HCOM help command will auto try functions if no matching command was found

- Enhancement: It is now possible to have multiple help links in the component help
- Enhancement: Help links can point to either local files, relative to the xml description, or to on-line web pages.
- Enhancement: Unit scaling with offset as well as scale are now supported (such as temperature)
               The scale and offset values follows the same convention as in the FMI standard
- Enhancement: Built in unit scales will no longer be saved in user configuration file, the default built-in values will always be used.
               This reduces the risk of using incorrect values.
- Enhancement: System parameters now support quantities/units and description
- Enhancement: It is now possible to edit system parameters after they have been added
- Enhancement: It is now possible to plot and check parameters (but not edit) inside fully locket external systems and locked local systems
- Enhancement: When the component properties dialogue is opened the model is locked to prevent editing, however, now it is possible to open additional properties dialogues
               or start a simulation. The dialogues have been given an apply button. You can now iterate the following: open a dialogue, change a parameter, simulate, look
               at the results. All without ever closing any windows or dialogues.
- Enhancement: The component properties dialogue for subsystems now look and behave the same as for ordinary components.
               But it still contain additional system specific settings.
- Enhancement: The expended items in the plot widget will now be remembered when you switch between two different models
- Enhancement: When exporting a model as .png, it is possible to choose if the background should be transparent or white. The original resolution is also shown.
- Enhancement: When a data variable is removed it will signal any plot using it to remove the curve or a curve custom x-data as appropriate.
               This reduces confusion when analysing the results.
- Enhancement: When a generation is missing from a data variable, that data curve will be hidden if the curve is set to that generation.
               (Rather then showing the wrong generation).
- Enhancement: When offsetting time for a specific generation, now all "Time" vectors in that generation will be affected at the same time.
               Time offset can be applied and checked from time offset dialogue, right-click menu in plot widget or HCOM commands "chto" and "dito".
- Enhancement: Systems and components now save their CQS-type as an attribute in the HMF file

- Documentation: The documentation has been reorganized and updated with new information about, how to setup the build environment to build Hopsan as a developer.
                 how to install the compiler for automatic compilation of External component libraries. Some new features are also covered, but sadly the documentation
                 is still lagging behind in some areas.
- Documentation: Added HCOM documentation on how to change curve styles from plot commands

- New components: Round, Ceil and Floor signal components
- New components: NumHop SingleInput SingleOutput interpreting component, write NumHop script that is evaluated without compilation. 
                  Code can be extended to support more inputs and outputs.
- New components: Hydraulic and Mechanic NodeSensor as well as Mechanic C and Q TLM input components make it possible to "graphically" program
                  the Transmission Line equations in a subsystem block. Note! this is still an experimental feature and performance will be lower
                  then if you write the code manually. 

- Fixed component: Some directional valve components had different speeds in positive and negative direction
- Fixed component: HydraulicCylinderC now has built in end-stops, so you should no longer rely on the connected Q-component (usually mass) to limit the stroke.

- Bug fixed: Messages from optimizations no longer appears in main window terminal
- Bug fixed: Memory leak when re-using models for subsequent optimizations
- Bug fixed: It is possible to copy/paste in locked external systems, it should not be possible
- Bug fixed: When a model is locked (external system) it is still possible to change or remove system parameters through the system parameter widget
- Bug fixed: When sorting the system parameters in the system parameter widget, the row indexes are messed up, making operations affect the wrong parameter
- Bug fixed: If you remove a system parameter from a system used as an external system, then the old parameter will be re-added once the master model is loaded
- Bug fixed: Hopsan crash after simulation due to progress bar deletion if something got in the way between finalizeDone signal and finish slot.
             (actually this was a problem with non blocking signals and slots)
- Bug fixed: Pressing Ctr+C (copy) without something selected will clear the current copy/cut stack.
             Not fun if you made something fancy, cut and then accidentally press copy instead of paste.
- Bug fixed: It is not possible to plot from a scope connected directly to a container port
- Bug fixed: Variables in subsystems do not know from which model they come
- Bug fixed: When setting a non string parameter to empty no error is shown and resulting evaluation will be zero
- Bug fixed: Can not reset string constants to default value if default value is empty string
- Bug fixed: External subsystem connectors are lost on copy paste
- Bug fixed: If you load a model containing a subsystem saved as a component and that component is not available in the library,
             nothing is created and no messages are shown. (There was a debug message but it has now been changed into an error message)
- Bug fixed: The default unit scale value for converting between Hz and rad/sec is inverted. (This was previously fixed in 0.6.12) but now 
             with quantity support in the code and a new unit scale system in the GUI, this is no longer an issue.
             Either you have frequency in rad/s (then use the Frequency quantity) or write unit Hz directly (then unit scaling will not work). 
- Bug fixed: Deactivated ports are not saved, so they reappear once a model is reloaded.

------------------------------
0.6.12  (2015-09-03)
- Note! We strongly suggest that you reset your configuration file ("Reset defaults" button in options dialog) after updating to this version, due to the erroneous handling of frequency unit scaling

- Bug fixed: The definition of Frequency scaling requires the base unit to be the SI-UNIT Hz, but in Hopsan we actually use rad/s.
             The default configuration setting for Frequency was inverted so that it scales relative to rad/s instead of Hz
             You need to reset your configuration file after updating to this version.
             If you have used Frequency scaling previously, you should really reload that model and reset the scaled parameter.
             Then make sure that you enter the correct frequency value.
             If you do not, an incorrect scale will be used.

- Bug fixed: Subsystem sometimes move from where you left them the second time you open them
- Bug fixed: Lookup Tables fail to read CSV files with Windows line endings

- Fixed component: Rewrote cavitation handling in CylinderQ
- Fixed component: Allow negative c in volumes in CylinderC (to avoid creating oil out if nothing when we get cavitation)

- Enhancement: When renaming a system parameter in the systems parameter widget, the values in components using the parameter should be updated to the new name
- Enhancement: Added backup and restore functions to first and second order transfer functions

               Some commands may have changed behavior (hopefully for the better)
- Enhancement: Port labels file in Simulink export now have a model specific name
- Enhancement: The component library widget has been completely rewritten to solve a number of problems.

         Note! The plotwindows can now have the same "display name" but "behind the scenes" the plotwindow name will be different.
         This means that you may not be able to switch the active plotwindow from HCOM.
- Fixed: When you load an external lib containing the same components as an earlier lib, those components are "removed" from earlier libs
- Fixed: When importing data containing Time, the Time variable will be moved to the __Imported__ category even though it should be shown in both categories.

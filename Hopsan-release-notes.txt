******************************
    Important Information
******************************

- See the issue-tracker https://github.com/Hopsan/hopsan/issues for all known issues.
  You can also report new issues, if you first create a GitHub account.

- There is no guarantee that the included component models are working under all conditions,
  you must decide for yourself if you trust the simulation results.

- When you load models saved with an older version of Hopsan, follow these recommendations to avoid loosing information:
  - Deactivate "Group Similar Messages" in the message widget at the bottom before loading a model.
  - Pay attention to any Warnings or Errors you may receive when loading your old model.
    If parameters fail to load they will be discarded.
  - Parameters and ports may have changed name, in such cases you have to manually set the parameter value that could
    not be loaded (according to messages).

- Sometime when exporting a model as PNG or PDF some components "vanish" or become very small. We have not been able to
  fix this problem. If this is a problem, take a screen-shot instead. You can quickly hide all of the side widgets with
  a button on the left pane.

- Hopsan internally relies on using the U.S English locale ( decimal separator '.' ) and should internally switch to
  this mode. Problems have been observed on some Ubuntu installations running with a different locale. Hopsan fails to
  interpret values with decimal separator '.' (it usually expects ','). If you do not want to change your system
  settings you can start Hopsan with the following command to locally ensure that U.S English numeric locale is used.
  Example:
    cd /opt/hopsan/bin
    LC_NUMERIC=C; ./hopsangui

    Version History
******************************
2.12.1-snap (2019-07-29)

This is a special release for the snap version of Hopsan.

--- Enhancements ---

- The snap now uses the base snap core18 (Ubuntu 18.04) and includes improvements for desktop theme support.
  The hopsan.gui and hopsan.holc applications should no longer look like "old software".
  Unfortunately dark themes are not yet working well, but this is a problem for all variants of Hopsan.

- Hopsan (snap version) will overwrite the compiler path so that the internal snap bundled version of the compiler
  is used automatically.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.12.0 (2019-07-15)

--- Enhancements ---

- HopsanCore:
  - Added petri net node type

- HopsanGUI:
  - Various text editor improvements
  - Enable saving and loading parameter sets to file (.hpf) for the entire model, sub-systems as well as individual components.
    Right click a component or subsytem to save or load parameter value sets.
    The HCOM sapa and repa commands have also been updated.

- HopsanCLI:
  - Made the --logonly command line argument affect only --resultsFullCSV output.
    --resultsFinalCSV will still include the final values from all ports.
    The purpose of --logonly is to reduce data amount for long simulations or optimizations with multiple iterations, but
    the --resultsFinalCSV data is not very large and having access to final values for ports that were not logged may be useful.

- HopsanGenerator:
  -Export model to black-box executable

--- Bug Fixes ---

- HopsanCore:
  - Fixed loading of parameter value sets for entire systems (including subsystems)

- HopsanGUI:
  - Fixed wrong XML tag when saving optimization settings

- HopsanGenerator:
  - Format of generationDateAndTime in exported FMU is not valid
  - Unable to recompile libraries when Hopsan installation path contains spaces

--- Component Libraries ---

- Corrected cavitation check for Q-type pumps

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--- Enhancements ---

- This is a special release for the first Flatpak build

- HopsanGUI:
  - "Apply & simulate" button in component properties dialog. Will apply all settings and simulate the model without closing the dialog.
  - Improved point plotting in Optimization
  - Use tables instead of widgets in layouts for optimization dialog
  - Launch batch/shell scripts from HCOM
    Launch .bat and .sh files using exec function in HCOM.
    Syntax: exec script.bat arg1 arg2 ...
  - Improved csv import support:
    Support import column csv with data names on first line
    Support importing row csv (names in first column)
    Auto-detect HopsanCLI csv format


--- Bug Fixes ---

- HopsanGUI:
  - Importing plot data in HCOM fails if no model is open
  - Fix out-of-range crash in DE optimization

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.11.0 (2019-01-25)

--- Enhancements ---

- HopsanCore:
  - Add quantity Resistance with base unit Ohm instead of "ohm".
    Also adds common unit scales to HopsanGUI.
  - Add common math functions to embedded script (numhop), see users guide for details.
    You can now write expression like "x=cos(y)" or "a=atan2(b,c+2)"

- HopsanGenerator:
  - Added generator for compiler commands that should work with both GCC and Clang.
    This is only used for library import compilation right now. It will be extended to FMU exporting later.
    This should enable custom library importing on MacOS from HopsanGUI (but this has not been tested).

- HopsanGUI:
  - Built-in script editor for HCOM scripts.
  - Improved auto-completer in HCOM terminal.
  - Case insensitive auto-completer for filter function in component library widget.
  - It is now possible to add trace variables from multiple selected ports in the "debugging" widget.
  - Improved find widget Ctrl+F, it now behaves similarly as in other application.
  - Units scales are now sorted by scale.
  - Removing three second real-time plotting window limit.
  - Made it possible to run real-time animation (and plotting) without needing a previous log data generation.
  - Add "chds" Change diagram size (and position) HCOM command.
  - Click anywhere on the workspace to quickly add new components. Write the name in the filter box.
  - The HoLC text editor functionality has been merged into HopsanGUI to improve and simplify the code editing experience.
  - Improved the save-state functionality so that it is possible to recompile libraries without first closing the models that are using them.
    Together with the code editor improvements this simplifies component development.

- HoLC:
  - Short-key Ctrl+G for quickly compiling (G for generate).
  - Zoom text with Ctrl+MouseWheel
  - Improved auto-completer, automatically show auto-complete suggestions while user is typing.
    Force-open auto-completer with Ctrl+Space
  - Find widget in HoLC text editor, open with Ctrl+F


--- Bug Fixes ---

- HopsanGUI:
  - Program crash after removal of disabled components.
  - Incorrect "parameter not used" warning when parameter values are given by expressions.
  - Plot unit selection does not allow a unit with scale one other than the base unit.
  - Import button in data explorer is now disable when no model is open, to prevent import data from
    going nowhere.
  - Crash when double-clicking scope in real-time animation without an existing generation.
  - Fix "real-time" plotting of play-back data. Now correct data index will be used instead of latest.
  - System parameters in expressions are not added when copy-pasting components into a new system.

--- Component Libraries ---

  - New spring-loaded switch animation component.
  - Add min and max limit parameters for animation slider component.
  - Add controller output limits to SignalPID2.
  - Add Hidden leakage flow port in CylinderC component.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.10.0 (2018-09-28)

--- Important Changes ---

- The component library XML format has been updated.
  See the included "componentLibraries\exampleComponentLib\exampleComponentLib.xml" for details.
  Note! Hopsan will still be able to load files of the previous version.

--- Enhancements ---

- Models:
  - Models will now know what external component libraries they require.
    Libraries should have an <id> element in their XML file for this to work.
    See the included "componentLibraries\exampleComponentLib\exampleComponentLib.xml" for details.

- FMU:
  - When a model is exported to FMU or S-function, any required external component library will be included in the
    export and compiled into the target.
    Note! This requires that the source-code for the library is available and that all components, source files or
    special build flags (if any) are listed in the component library XML. You can use HoLC (Hopsan Library Creator),
    to add existing component files using a graphical users interface, but you can also update the library XML file
    manually in a text editor.
  - When a model that depend on data files (assets) is exported as an FMU, these files will now be included inside
    the FMU, in the (resources) directory.
    Note! Currently, any data file is included regardless of its size. This may pose a problem for very large files.
  - When a model is exported into an FMU, the exported directory structure is much cleaner, and the FMU easier to find.
    Temporary build and staging files are put into DESTINATION/fmu_build and DESTINATION/fmu_stage.
    These directories are deleted the next time an FMU is exported to the same directory.

- HoLC:
  - It is now possible to reload a file that was changed outside of HoLC, without restarting the program.
  - It is now possible to add multiple existing files at the same time.
  - Add existing files dialogues will now remember the last used directory.

--- Bug Fixes ---

- HoLC:
  - It is no longer assumed that the name of library main XML and cpp files are the same as the library.
    This allows overwriting existing library files on save.
  - Build flags are now preserved when loading and saving a library XML file.
    (You must still enter them manually in a text editor)
  - The file dialog suffix filters should now work.

- FMU:
  - Hopsan models exported as FMUs will no longer crash after 1/Ts simulation steps.

- HopsanGUI:
  - Prevent severe slowdown after simulation when result data is collected.
    This was especially noticable for large model or when many generations had been collected.

- Simulation:
  - Disabled components are now allowed to have non-connected ports.
    Note! If you disable components that are connected to enabled ones,
    the simulation may not behave as you expect.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.9.0 (2018-07-02)

--- Important Changes ---

- The HopsanGenerator library refactoring. GUI parts were split into a separate library and the library now has a C API
- All Hopsan source files now use the file suffix '.cpp' rather then mixing '.cpp' and '.cc'.
- All binaries now use lower-case names (hopsancli.exe instead of HopsanCLI.exe).
- Continuous integration (Travis CI) and (Appveyor) now builds and tests every change to the Hopsan code.
  This will reduce the risk of new code breaking old functionality.

--- Updates ---

- Update Qt to 5.6.3 on Windows (official Windows 10 support).
- Update the 64-bit Windows compiler to MinGW 4.9.4 (from 4.9.3). If you have manually set up a build environment for
  custom component libraries you are encouraged to update (use one of the Hopsan downloads with compiler included).
- Update ZeroMQ to 4.2.5

--- Enhancements ---

- Optimization:
  - Improved script file handling.
  - Improved variable names in plots.
  - Points are now sorted by objective value with DE algorithm.
  - Script generation is now shown in a separate wizard.
  - Reduced terminal output during optimization.
  - New algorithm, Genetic Algorithm.

- FMU:
  - Exported Hopsan FMUs will now report Warning and Error messages. Info messages will be reported as Debug type.
  - Imported FMUs will now have their messages redirected to the Hopsan core logger instead of standard output.
    messages should now be visible inside HopsanGUI. Enable Debug messages to see FMU Info messages.

- HopsanGUI:
  - HCOM:
    - Add PI constant 'pi()' in HCOM script.
    - Add argument to filter DIPA output
    - Add round, floor and ceil functions
    - Add unco command to list ports that are not connected
  - Export plot to image dialog will close after successful export.
  - Generator import/recompilation dialogs will now auto close if the import succeeds. Various improvement have also
    been made to the generator error handling to prevent importing old leftover files if compilation fails.
  - Improved Hopsan core log file handling, the log file is now put in the temporary directory next to log cache files.
  - Debug messages with log data collection speed has been added to help debug severe slowdown problems after the
    simulation is finish. Enable debug messages to show them.
  - The 32 bit version now includes openssl libraries so that the news feed can be accessed.

- HopsanCLI:
  - The HopsanCLI takes a new argument '--log.corelogfile' to specify core log destination.
    If not specified, the current working directory will be used.
  - It is now possible to choose what ports to log when simulating using HopsanCLI.
    Use the '--logonly' command line argument, and specify a comma-separated list of full port names.
    It is also possible to alternatively specify a text file with one full port name per line.
    Examples: Gain#out or SubsystemName#Gain#out
  - When saving results from a HopsanCLI simulation, interface ports (system ports) will also be saved.
  - Results saved by HopsanCLI now use scientific notation, this may increase precision for small values.

--- Bug Fixes ---

- Optimization:
  - Plot windows should be reusable.
  - Progress bars do not show with DE algorithm.
  - Excessive progress bars are not removed when reducing number of models.
  - Total progress bar is not updated with PSO algorithm.

- FMU:
  - An exported Hopsan FMU will not signal failure if initialize or simulate fails.
  - FMUs from JModelica cannot be imported.
    The import code now supports 'CS and ME' FMUs. In this case the Co-Simulation variant will be used.

- HopsanGUI:
  - The auto update link parser ignores Hopsan without compiler links.
  - Animation crashes when variable is NaN or inf.

--- Component Libraries ---

- Fix inverted port initialization error in HydraulicTLMlossless.
- Fix error in pilot operated check valve.
- Fix error in HydraulicPistonAccumulator.
- The "Extension library" is now included by default with Hopsan. You can load it from the Hopsan installation directory.
  This library contains experimental new components that have not yet been added to the default library.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.8.2 (2018-03-02)
- Bug fixed: HCOM max(abs(var)) fail to evaluate if var is a vector (also affects min)
- Bug fixed: Optimization: There should be a comma separator between the numbers in the parameter outputs

- Enhancement: It is now possible to choose what temp directory to use for the Hopsan GUI cache.
               This may be helpful if the default directory is located on a slow network drive.
               After each simulation, potentially very large log data cache files will be written here.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.8.1 (2017-11-30)
- Bug fixed: Prevent notifying that a new version is available if Hospan release "revision" is newer then the HopsanGUI "revision" in the same release.
- Bug fixed: Numbers are inverted in custom unit scale display dialogue. Actually they were not. They were supposed to be part of an equation, this is now shown.
- Bug fixed: If Hopsan is terminated or crash while the configuration file is saved, it will no longer become corrupt. (The previous version will remain intact)
- Bug fixed: The Linux version of Hopsan 2.8.0 can not dlopen libHopsanGenerator making it impossible to (re)compile external component libraries

- Enhancement: Auto download of new (Windows) versions will now save installer to the user "temp" directory rather than the "data" directory.
               You should check your data directory for old installers and delete them manually!
               Look in "C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\HopsanGUI" or similar.
- Enhancement: Greatly improved error/warning  message output while loading external libraries, this should prevent bug: "Sometimes external components fails to load without error message"
- Enhancement: Added km/h, mph and knot custom speed units (Note! You can add your own in the Options menu if your favorites are missing)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.8.0 (2017-10-13)
- Change: Moved source code to GitHub: https://github.com/Hopsan/hopsan
          Due to switching source code version control system from Subversion to Git(Hub), significant changes have been made to the build system and version numbering format.

- Change: New version numbering format (we also bumped the epoch number to avoid confusion with the previous generation of Hopsan (Version 1.4 released in 2001)
          The new full version number format is: EPOCH.MAJOR.MINOR.DATE.TIME~BRANCH_NAME
          For official releases, only the three first numbers will be shown in the file name, example: 2.8.0. But internally and for snapshots the date and time of the last commit will be appended.
          This gives a behaviour that is similar to the monotonically increasing revision number used previously when the source code was handled by Subversion.
          Optionally the branch name may be appended in the end (for experimental or snapshot builds, that do not originate from the "master" branch.

- Change: Re-licensed HopsanCore, HopsanCLI, libOps, libSymHop, libHopsanGenerator and libDefaultLibrary to Apache License 2.0
          This is a more permissive license than the GPL license previously used.
          Essentially: If you create derived work of the Hopsan core components (and distribute that work), your work must no longer be released under the GPL license.
          Note! HopsanGUI and HoLC (the GUI applications) are still GPLv3 licensed.
          Read the full license notices for details.

- Change: Removed obsolete csv_parser++ library (GPL licensed) from HopsanCore
          libIndexingCSVParser is used everywhere instead (compiled into HopsanCore)

- Change: Removed Intel Thread Building Blocks library.
          HopsanCore now relies on C++11 std::threads for multi-threading capabilities.

- Feature: Vector signal nodes. Note! Only realized by 2D node components as of yet.
           These nodes are still static, so there would have to be a set of components for every vector size.
- Feature: Bi-directional signal ports (2D) read/write.
           See external Grafcet example library
- Feature: HCOM New 'eval' command, Evaluate string expressions.
           Example: eval "chpv Gain$i$.out.y" would first evaluate the variable i and then execute the 'chpv' command
- Feature: HCOM New 'mkdir' command, to create directories. 
           This may be useful when automate saving of data

- Enhancement: The version check and auto update (Windows only) system has been improved. If you have downloaded a version with the compiler included,
               the auto update will now be able to download the new version also with the compiler included.

- Bug fixed: Prevent crash when copying HVectors of HStrings

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Bug fixed: Confusion in variable lookup when matching against alias names, causing incorrect behaviour of rmvar HCOM command (and likely others),
             'rmvar aliasname', will now remove the alias variable itself and unregister the alias name from the actual real variable.

- Enhancement: Increased precision (double to string conversion) of some HCOM scalar outputs and the plot markers display text.
- Enhancement: The 'to_hstring' utility function now takes an additional 'precision' argument, so that the precision of the resulting string
               can be chosen. The default value is 17, this resolves issues with evaluated numerical expressions in parameters getting truncated.
- Enhancement: Limited boolean operator support in numhop, true = 1 and false = 0

               The user name can be set in HopsanGUI or supplied to the RemoteClient command line tool.
- Enhancement: Disabled editing, solver selection and recompile button in the code viewer (in Component Properties) for C++ components since it is not possible to  
               actually change / recompile individual components from within HopsanGUI. This was causing confusion.
- Enhancement: Disabled the "Dual View" in the library widget since it will fail to show all components in some cases. Fixing the problem will require to much work,
               the code is still there if someone want to give it a try. This change also removes the "HelpButton" but the UsersGuide is still available through the help menu.

- New component: Hydraulic Piston Accumulator has been added  

- Bug fixed: When loading a model from a 0.6 version of Hopsan using custom parameter scales, the scale factors are inverted in the properties dialog.
             (Simulation is not affected!)
             When a scale mismatch is detected on loading a model, it will now be updated to the latest version.
             Note! Since old versions of Hopsan does not have this fix, the unit scales saved in a model from Hopsan 0.7 are not backwards compatible with Hopsan 0.6.
- Bug fixed: It is not possible to use HCOM function calls as arguments to HCOM commands if spaces exist in the argument list to the function call
- Bug fixed: HCOM crash if taking square of temporary vector expression
- Bug fixed: Rare crash due to "double free" in SymHop Expression destructor 
- Bug fixed: HCOM scalar/vector division falls back to startvalue for vector name instead of using the vector
             It will now be interpreted as (scalar * 1 ./ vector) (scalar * Element-wise inverted vector)
- Bug fixed: In xy-plots the unit label for custom x-axis was incorrect, it got the y-axis unit

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.7.3  (2016-02-23)
- Feature: Running optimizations from HopsanCLI

- Enhancement: If you select multiple system parameters then all components with selected parameters will be highlight
- Enhancement: No longer listing system port variables twice in the plot widget
- Enhancement: PortType is now saved in port tag in model xml (for external tools)

- New component: Mechanic worm drive

- Bug fixed: If you close a model the numhop script dialog is not closed with it
- Bug fixed: Sometimes no data is saved in the log variables collected from the core (if you start a second Hopsan instance the cache files were deleted)
- Bug fixed: It is no longer possible to add or change system parameters in "limitedlocked" systems
- Bug fixed: When editing a system parameter of other type then double, the type selector still defaults to double
- Bug fixed: Crash on Windows 8 and 10 after renaming a system port and later saving (or in some other way triggering refresh port appearance)
- Bug fixed: Parameter sweep optimization is not working, sometime dialog is crashed as well

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.7.2  (2016-02-06)
- Feature: Additional versions of the Windows installer and zip release are now available with the compiler included.
           This version will default to the internal compiler (see options to set other compiler paths).
           Note! For compression reasons (to keep the file small) the portable "zip" release including compiler uses the "7z" format
                 and requires the free "7-Zip" program from http://www.7-zip.org/ to unpack.
- Feature: Hopsan can now utilize remote simulation services for parallel simulation during sensitivity analysis.
           Note! This is only beneficial for large models that take a long time to simulate. Overhead from remote loading of models and especially transferring data back
           to the HopsanGUI will add to the total simulation time for each model.

- Enhancement: Imported FMUs will now inherit ComponentSignal by default, (instead of Q-type). When a HopsanTLM port specification is present in the FMU the C or Q
               type can be decided in that file (using the "tlmcqtype" tag). If not specified, Q-type will be assumed.
- Enhancement: FMU import HopsanTLM specification now works with all built in node types in Hopsan. (Before, only Hydraulic and Mechanic ports were supported)
               The Hopsan node type name must be used in the "type" attribute of the "tlmport" tag. Example: "NodeElectric" not "electriccq".

- Bug fixed: Exported FMU wont compile due to failed namespace replacement in new code
- Bug fixed: The simulate multiple models or all open models code in the ModelHandler sometimes causes crash after simulation
- Bug fixed: When importing FMU the FMILibrary path does not work if Hopsan is installed in for example "Program Files" (space in path)
- Bug fixed: Highlighting components using system parameters does not work if system parameter is used in expression
- Bug fixed: Importing FMU with _ in name causes problems (due to to strict toValidVariableName function)
- Bug fixed: Crash if trying to use remote parallel optimization using an algorithm or method that has not been implemented in the scheduler
             It will now fall back to parallel queuer without load balancing
- Bug fixed: Fixed incorrect rad/s -> rpm unit scale
- Bug fixed: Fixed rare crash bug in SymHop library 
- Bug fixed: Fixed crash bugs related to optimization "hidden models"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.7.1  (2016-01-28)
- Enhancement: It is now possible to trigger the "invert plot" function for a data variable through the plot curve controls.
- Enhancement: The time offset dialog and hcom commands now use the selected default time unit for input and output
- Enhancement: NumHop dialog now has an apply button so that you can edit and apply changes without closing the dialog

- Fixed component: CylinderC now have the possibility to disable internal end stop simulation
- Fixed component: Lookup table components are no longer tagged as Experimental (they seem to be working)
- Fixed component: Hydraulic32DirectionalOnOffValve does not allow flow from load port to tank after bug fix to 0.7.0.
                   Also added validation tests to prevent this from happening again
- Fixed component: Electric motor components had wrong unit for Viscous friction coefficient (only fixed in generated C++ code)

- Bug fixed: When opening component properties dialog for a subsystem the model is locked, the dialog seems to be modal (it now behaves as ordinary components)
- Bug fixed: Added missing check for feasible region in differential evolution optimization algorithm

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.7.0  (2016-01-26)
- Note: This version has been in development for approximately one year.
        There are many changes that are not mentioned in these release notes.
- Note: The abs HCOM command has been removed, use the abs() function instead.
- Note: The HCOM plot scale and plot offset commands have been removed. (The features have been removed as well)
        Use quantities or generation specific time plot offset
- Note: The core Component functions setInitialValue() and readNodeSafeSlow() and writeNodeSafeSlow() have been removed. Use writeNodeSafe() or readNodeSafe() instead.
- Note: Now one logdata handler is shared for the entire model instead of for each individual subsystem, this greatly simplifies working with Generations of data.
        The full system hierarchy of data is now available in the same tree.
- Note: We have finally chosen a real license, and made sure that third-party dependencies are compatible.
        This version of Hopsan is released under the GNU GPL version 3 license.
        If you would like to use a different license, please contact Fluid and Mechatronic Systems, Linköping University,
        and consider sponsoring the development of Hopsan.
- Note: This release has updated to MinGW-W64 4.9.3 and a custom compiled version of the Qt Libraries 5.4.2 (for this 64-bit compiler)
        See the documentation for details.

- Feature: A remote Hopsan simulation framework has been developed and is included in this release.
           Unfortunately there is no documentation about how to use it but if you are clever, you can probably figure it out.
           Run the following programs with the "--help" flag for more information:
           hopsanaddressserver.exe, hopsanserver.exe, hopsanserverclient.exe, hopsanservermonitor.exe
           HopsanGUI can connect to the server(s) and run remote simulation, and some optimization algorithms can run in parallel if many server computers are set up.
           Note! This is VERY experimental.
- Feature: It is now possible to set plot label in the component properties dialogue, this label will be used in plot legend (overwriting full name and alias)
- Feature: Components (including subsystems) in a model can now be locked, which prevents editing
- Feature: Ii is now possible to revert model to the last saved state without loosing plot windows and log data generations (Tools menu)
- Feature: It is now possible to invert specific plot variables from HCOM "ivpv" and component properties
           Inverting may be useful for analysis purposes, but only the plot curves will be affected. The data will keep the correct value.
- Feature: HopsanGUI can now automatically compile (and recompile) External component libraries when they are loaded.
           This means that you no longer need an external build environment for component library development. 
           (You can still use that for advanced development)
- Feature: It is now possible to recompile or reload external component libraries from the library widget right-click menu.
           Provided, that the correct compiler version is installed and selected in Options. (See documentation for details)
- Feature: It is now possible to start HopsanGUI from the command line, and pass a HCOM script as the first argument. The script will be executed on start-up.
           Note! the script file name used as the argument must end in .hcom, otherwise it will be treated as an hmf file to load.
- Feature: Quantities definitions have been moved to the simulation core, so you can now assign quantities directly in the component code
- Feature: It is now possible to set Quantity on signals (that have no quantity set in code) so that the desired description and units are used in plots.
           Instead of showing "Value". Note! No check will be done that units match, you have to take care of that yourself.
- Feature: HopsanGUI now supports data export in the standardized HDF5 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format format. 
           This format has import support in many popular softwares. The format stores data without truncation and includes variable meta data.
           A helper scripts for convenient import in Matlab is included in the Hopsan release (Check the Scripts directory)
- Feature: Help description for components can now be written in Markdown (a simple text format) that is automatically converted to HTML in HopsanGUI.
           Additionally LaTeX equations are supported and will automatically be rendered into the HTML document.
- Feature: A model embedded script language NumHop is now part of each system component. Using NumHop you can write an initialization script
           that will be run for each system to set defaultStartValue parameter. This is useful if you need to calculate start values based on other parameters
           in your model. See the NumHop script section in the documentation.
- Feature: Symbolic expressions can now be used as parameter values, this make it possible to base one parameter on another in the same component or 
           use a system parameter directly or included in a mathematical expression. See the NumHop script section in the documentation.
- Feature: It is now possible to set star values in system ports.
- Feature: It is now possible to save the state of a simulation and to later load that state to continue the simulation from a certain point.
           Note! Internal states of the components are not saved, only the interface (node) values. You make the save/restore at steady-state.
           This functionality is available in the HopsanCLI (see CLI documentation)
           And in the HopsanGUI see the Export menu, and the -loadstate and -loadsv argument to the HCOM "sim" command.
- Feature: It is now possible to get node data pointer structures from ports, this makes it easier to write cleaner component code.
           Especially if you have many ports or even multi ports. Currently this is experimental and only available for Hydraulic and Mechanic nodes.
- Feature: The HoLC (HopsanLibraryCreator) program is included in this release, you can us it to generate the component library files and component code skeletons.
           It also offers limited code editor functionality.
- Feature: External subsystems (.hmf) can now be used as components in the component library

- Enhancement: HCOM set command can now take variables as arguments
- Enhancement: HCOM get command, which displays current settings
- Enhancement: HCOM help command will auto try functions if no matching command was found

- Enhancement: It is now possible to have multiple help links in the component help
- Enhancement: Help links can point to either local files, relative to the xml description, or to on-line web pages.
- Enhancement: Unit scaling with offset as well as scale are now supported (such as temperature)
               The scale and offset values follows the same convention as in the FMI standard
- Enhancement: Built in unit scales will no longer be saved in user configuration file, the default built-in values will always be used.
               This reduces the risk of using incorrect values.
- Enhancement: System parameters now support quantities/units and description
- Enhancement: It is now possible to edit system parameters after they have been added
- Enhancement: It is now possible to plot and check parameters (but not edit) inside fully locket external systems and locked local systems
- Enhancement: When the component properties dialogue is opened the model is locked to prevent editing, however, now it is possible to open additional properties dialogues
               or start a simulation. The dialogues have been given an apply button. You can now iterate the following: open a dialogue, change a parameter, simulate, look
               at the results. All without ever closing any windows or dialogues.
- Enhancement: The component properties dialogue for subsystems now look and behave the same as for ordinary components.
               But it still contain additional system specific settings.
- Enhancement: The expended items in the plot widget will now be remembered when you switch between two different models
- Enhancement: When exporting a model as .png, it is possible to choose if the background should be transparent or white. The original resolution is also shown.
- Enhancement: When a data variable is removed it will signal any plot using it to remove the curve or a curve custom x-data as appropriate.
               This reduces confusion when analysing the results.
- Enhancement: When a generation is missing from a data variable, that data curve will be hidden if the curve is set to that generation.
               (Rather then showing the wrong generation).
- Enhancement: When offsetting time for a specific generation, now all "Time" vectors in that generation will be affected at the same time.
               Time offset can be applied and checked from time offset dialogue, right-click menu in plot widget or HCOM commands "chto" and "dito".
- Enhancement: Systems and components now save their CQS-type as an attribute in the HMF file

- Documentation: The documentation has been reorganized and updated with new information about, how to setup the build environment to build Hopsan as a developer.
                 how to install the compiler for automatic compilation of External component libraries. Some new features are also covered, but sadly the documentation
                 is still lagging behind in some areas.
- Documentation: Added HCOM documentation on how to change curve styles from plot commands

- New components: Round, Ceil and Floor signal components
- New components: NumHop SingleInput SingleOutput interpreting component, write NumHop script that is evaluated without compilation. 
                  Code can be extended to support more inputs and outputs.
- New components: Hydraulic and Mechanic NodeSensor as well as Mechanic C and Q TLM input components make it possible to "graphically" program
                  the Transmission Line equations in a subsystem block. Note! this is still an experimental feature and performance will be lower
                  then if you write the code manually. 

- Fixed component: Some directional valve components had different speeds in positive and negative direction
- Fixed component: HydraulicCylinderC now has built in end-stops, so you should no longer rely on the connected Q-component (usually mass) to limit the stroke.

- Bug fixed: Messages from optimizations no longer appears in main window terminal
- Bug fixed: Memory leak when re-using models for subsequent optimizations
- Bug fixed: It is possible to copy/paste in locked external systems, it should not be possible
- Bug fixed: When a model is locked (external system) it is still possible to change or remove system parameters through the system parameter widget
- Bug fixed: When sorting the system parameters in the system parameter widget, the row indexes are messed up, making operations affect the wrong parameter
- Bug fixed: If you remove a system parameter from a system used as an external system, then the old parameter will be re-added once the master model is loaded
- Bug fixed: Hopsan crash after simulation due to progress bar deletion if something got in the way between finalizeDone signal and finish slot.
             (actually this was a problem with non blocking signals and slots)
- Bug fixed: Pressing Ctr+C (copy) without something selected will clear the current copy/cut stack.
             Not fun if you made something fancy, cut and then accidentally press copy instead of paste.
- Bug fixed: It is not possible to plot from a scope connected directly to a container port
- Bug fixed: Variables in subsystems do not know from which model they come
- Bug fixed: When setting a non string parameter to empty no error is shown and resulting evaluation will be zero
- Bug fixed: Can not reset string constants to default value if default value is empty string
- Bug fixed: External subsystem connectors are lost on copy paste
- Bug fixed: If you load a model containing a subsystem saved as a component and that component is not available in the library,
             nothing is created and no messages are shown. (There was a debug message but it has now been changed into an error message)
- Bug fixed: The default unit scale value for converting between Hz and rad/sec is inverted. (This was previously fixed in 0.6.12) but now 
             with quantity support in the code and a new unit scale system in the GUI, this is no longer an issue.
             Either you have frequency in rad/s (then use the Frequency quantity) or write unit Hz directly (then unit scaling will not work). 
- Bug fixed: Deactivated ports are not saved, so they reappear once a model is reloaded.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.6.12  (2015-09-03)
- Note! We strongly suggest that you reset your configuration file ("Reset defaults" button in options dialog) after updating to this version, due to the erroneous handling of frequency unit scaling

- Bug fixed: The definition of Frequency scaling requires the base unit to be the SI-UNIT Hz, but in Hopsan we actually use rad/s.
             The default configuration setting for Frequency was inverted so that it scales relative to rad/s instead of Hz
             You need to reset your configuration file after updating to this version.
             If you have used Frequency scaling previously, you should really reload that model and reset the scaled parameter.
             Then make sure that you enter the correct frequency value.
             If you do not, an incorrect scale will be used.

- Bug fixed: Subsystem sometimes move from where you left them the second time you open them
- Bug fixed: Lookup Tables fail to read CSV files with Windows line endings
- Bug fixed: Calling initialize on SecondOrderFilter will not reset the output value variable, its value remains unchanged
- Bug fixed: HopsanCore simulation freeze sometimes when calling stopSimulation() during multi-core simulation
- Bug fixed: Fixed crash in optimization finalize function
- Bug fixed: Made sure disabled ports in original model are respected by optimization handler
- Bug fixed: When creating a new subsystem the default viewport is set to the top-left corner

- Fixed component: Fixed division by zero in hydraulic pressure controlled pump component
- Fixed component: Enabled stroke limitation of HydraulicCylinderC. Hopefully it works as intended
- Fixed component: Rewrote cavitation handling in CylinderQ
- Fixed component: Allow negative c in volumes in CylinderC (to avoid creating oil out if nothing when we get cavitation)

- Enhancement: When renaming a system parameter in the systems parameter widget, the values in components using the parameter should be updated to the new name
- Enhancement: Added backup and restore functions to first and second order transfer functions

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

               Some commands may have changed behavior (hopefully for the better)
- Enhancement: Port labels file in Simulink export now have a model specific name
- Enhancement: The component library widget has been completely rewritten to solve a number of problems.

         Note! The plotwindows can now have the same "display name" but "behind the scenes" the plotwindow name will be different.
         This means that you may not be able to switch the active plotwindow from HCOM.
- Fixed: When you load an external lib containing the same components as an earlier lib, those components are "removed" from earlier libs
- Fixed: When importing data containing Time, the Time variable will be moved to the __Imported__ category even though it should be shown in both categories.

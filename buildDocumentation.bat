REM Now we need to add the Ghostscript bin folder to path so that formulas can be built
REM We need 32-bit Ghostscript version as it seems to be hard-coded in Doxygen (using alias does not work)
REM Lets add default path for installation on both 32 and 64 bit Windows
REM TODO: It would be nice if we would not need to rely on a specific version here, (search for available version by itself)
